# EE2016
Assignments from the EE2016: Microprocessor Lab+Theory course offered by IIT-M.  
This course taught us AVR and ARM assembling programming, among other things.  

- For AVR we used [Microchip Studio 7.0](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/microchip-studio-for-avr-and-sam-devices) to emulate an ATmega8 microcontroller.
- For ARM we used [Keil ÂµVision5](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/) to emulate an LPC2378 microcontroller.
