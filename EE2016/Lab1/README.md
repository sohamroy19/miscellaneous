#### Problem 1 (Common 8-bit mathematical operation):
Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).  
<br>

#### Problem 2 (16-bit addition using a 8-bit processor):
Given two 16-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).  
<br>
  
#### Problem 3 (Multiplication of two 8-bit numbers):
Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the product and store it in register(s).  
<br>
  
#### Problem 4 (Largest of number given):
Given a finite set of binary words, load them-from memory, identify the largest in the given set, and store this largest number in SRAM.  

There are two solutions to this problem, [one](Problem4.asm) for unsigned and [another](Problem4signed.asm) for signed.  
Also checkout the [solution](https://github.com/HR-1-1/CourseWork/blob/main/EE2016/LAB%201/LargestNumber.asm) by [Harish](https://github.com/HR-1-1) for a more universal way!
