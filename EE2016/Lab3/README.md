#### Problem 1 (`Factorial.s`):
Compute the factorial of a given number using ARM processor through assembly programming.  
<br>

#### Problem 2 (`List.s`):
Combine the low four bits of each of the four consecutive bytes beginning at LIST into one 16-bit halfword. The value at LIST goes into the most significant nibble of the result. Store the result in the 32-bit variable RESULT.

#### Problem 3 (`Odd.s`):
Given a 32 bit number, identify whether it is an even or odd. (You implementation should not involve division)
