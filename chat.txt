10/08/2021, 19:11 - Manomukil T: Just a small suspicion
10/08/2021, 19:11 - Manomukil T: That's all imo
10/08/2021, 19:12 - Soham Roy: Windows updates making it slow would mean more people go for Apple, whereas iPhone getting slower means the person buys a new iPhone as Apple has exchange offers
10/08/2021, 19:12 - Soham Roy: Apple has monopoly over its cult-like iPhone fanbase, whereas Windows will simply not profit by making Windows slow at all
10/08/2021, 19:13 - Soham Roy: Windows and Android hardware markets are also very open, if Samsung made their phones slow then people would switch to Xiaomi/iPhone
10/08/2021, 19:14 - Manomukil T: With the emergence of cloud storage  mainly ig... it has now made transfer to non ios devices also possible
10/08/2021, 19:14 - Soham Roy: Whereas I have seen people upgrade to newer iPhones just coz iPhone 6 no longer supports UPI apps (no reason, they claim security)
10/08/2021, 19:15 - Soham Roy: it is possible, but people just don't do it
10/08/2021, 19:15 - Manomukil T: True that
10/08/2021, 19:15 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: They also limit software updates and you can't keep up with requirements in app store anymore
10/08/2021, 19:15 - Soham Roy: In their defence iPhone 6 is really old tho
10/08/2021, 19:16 - Manomukil T: Demn it's been 7 years
10/08/2021, 19:16 - Soham Roy: But taking back UPI support that was already present is just completely unnecessary
10/08/2021, 19:17 - Manomukil T: Prolly coz proportion of people using iPhone 6 rn might be less
10/08/2021, 19:17 - Manomukil T: So even if they switch to another brand which I doubt they will...
10/08/2021, 19:17 - Manomukil T: It shouldn't hurt apple
10/08/2021, 19:17 - Soham Roy: Then they would never have implemented it, sir
10/08/2021, 19:17 - Soham Roy: iPhone 6 supported UPI until suddenly it did not
10/08/2021, 19:18 - Manomukil T: That o thought would atleast push some people to buy newer versions of iPhone if not all
10/08/2021, 19:18 - Manomukil T: Im just a noob don't say sir and all😂
10/08/2021, 19:18 - Manomukil T: *I
10/08/2021, 19:19 - Soham Roy: That is planned obsolescence na, if they had never implemented then your point would have been possible
10/08/2021, 19:19 - Manomukil T: Ohh
10/08/2021, 19:19 - Rushill Bairavan: 😶
10/08/2021, 19:19 - Manomukil T: U mean they wouldn't have implemented UPI at all?
10/08/2021, 19:20 - Soham Roy: Yeah if they felt that too less people used iPhone 6
10/08/2021, 19:20 - Soham Roy: and not like they have to do anything about it
10/08/2021, 19:21 - Manomukil T: UPI came two years later tho after iPhone 6 launch
10/08/2021, 19:21 - Soham Roy: iPhone 6 worked with UPI for quite a few months
10/08/2021, 19:21 - Manomukil T: Just months aa? I didn't know that
10/08/2021, 19:22 - Manomukil T: I thought prolly few years or something it would have been there
10/08/2021, 19:22 - Soham Roy: Not like they have to do anything to get UPI to work
10/08/2021, 19:23 - Manomukil T: Do y then implement UPI?
10/08/2021, 19:23 - Manomukil T: *So
10/08/2021, 19:27 - Soham Roy: They basically declared iPhone 6 unsafe for upi
10/08/2021, 19:27 - Ishaan Agarwal: Nothing beats apple if you're okay with a one time big investment tho.
10/08/2021, 19:47 - Manomukil T: I get this part.. but y include upi if ur gonna remove it in the short term
10/08/2021, 19:47 - Manomukil T: Like what's the motive behind this?
10/08/2021, 19:47 - Harisankar K J: Unless you want to game
10/08/2021, 19:48 - Manomukil T: Increasing no of users means those apps have to pay appstore more or something?
10/08/2021, 19:49 - Soham Roy: they want iPhone 6 users to upgrade
10/08/2021, 19:54 - Manomukil T: So they give them a feel of UPI and make them rely on it
10/08/2021, 19:54 - Manomukil T: And then disable it
10/08/2021, 19:54 - Manomukil T: So they can upgrade?
10/08/2021, 19:59 - Soham Roy: Perhaps
10/08/2021, 20:09 - Manomukil T: Hmm
10/08/2021, 20:55 - Rushill Bairavan: <Media omitted>

11/08/2021, 15:22 - Ashita Anil: That was exactly my point to stfu and stop spreading this toxicity
11/08/2021, 15:28 - Bijo John: Exactly, all I wanted is for him to stop that, but sadly, my powers are not enough here 😪

11/08/2021, 15:33 - Kushagra Agrawal: What I think is 
Rama doesn't hv any friends. Maybe that is why he is so sad and he is ranting on the grp to gain sympathy and friends..
11/08/2021, 15:34 - Bijo John: Ranting won't get you friends... well maybe it can, but not when it's done to such excessive levels
11/08/2021, 15:34 - Kushagra Agrawal: Well it seems like he doesn't know that...
11/08/2021, 15:34 - Ashita Anil: Get one hobby na

11/08/2021, 15:39 - Manomukil T: We can only do so much to convince people... if they still don't agree .... put peace and leave it 🙂
11/08/2021, 15:40 - Kushagra Agrawal: ++
11/08/2021, 15:40 - Bijo John: I'm not trying to convince him at this point, I've realised it's impossible. All I'm hoping for is that his ideas don't cause others to be depressed
11/08/2021, 15:40 - Ashita Anil: Bijo
 paavam tries
11/08/2021, 15:41 - Kushagra Agrawal: Save us O lord Bijo
11/08/2021, 15:41 - Bijo John: Ig my effort was counterproductive tho, seenzoning is much better at stopping attention to his views
11/08/2021, 15:41 - Manomukil T: Then we have to step up the positivity from our side🙂
11/08/2021, 15:41 - Manomukil T: But in a way that we don't argue
11/08/2021, 15:41 - Bijo John: 😕

11/08/2021, 15:46 - Bijo John: Truth about what?
11/08/2021, 15:46 - Manomukil T: Ur mssgs are too depressing man... tone it down?
11/08/2021, 15:46 - Manomukil T: A little bit atleast?
11/08/2021, 15:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: No use bro
11/08/2021, 15:47 - Ruthika: 🙂
11/08/2021, 15:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: He will then think 5 times bfore he sends every messege
11/08/2021, 15:47 - Ruthika: That'd further depress him
11/08/2021, 15:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: ++

11/08/2021, 15:47 - Bijo John: Well, saying it outright is weird maxx, also iirc saurav mentioned on group once something like that, he didn't care

16/08/2021, 22:03 - Bijo John: Does using public wifi automatically entitle you to 'rights' for using it? It's something they provide and users are expected to know the limitations
16/08/2021, 22:03 - Nipun EE: Saar a restaurant not making idlis ≠ restricting your freedom to eat them

16/08/2021, 22:04 - Nipun EE: IG so 🤷‍♂️ I dunno really
16/08/2021, 22:04 - Nipun EE: The idli analogy struck me, I said 😂😂
16/08/2021, 22:05 - Bijo John: Maybe beg them to let it work
16/08/2021, 22:05 - Harisankar K J: Idli?
16/08/2021, 22:05 - Ishaan Agarwal: The ISP provides me "internet access", what websites I visit with it should be my choice.

16/08/2021, 22:06 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
16/08/2021, 22:07 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Banning moodle doesn't affect net neutrality in any way right?
16/08/2021, 22:07 - Soham Roy: But it's a needless infringement of freedom
16/08/2021, 22:07 - Soham Roy: If the government does it, then no, if the ISP does it then yes
16/08/2021, 22:07 - Soham Roy: Which is why government's banning of random sites shouldn't be taken lightly
16/08/2021, 22:07 - Soham Roy: + this

Whoever wants to open IIT Madras, please send mail here
19/08/2021, 11:17 - Ishaan Agarwal: Respected sir,
I am a student of IIT madras studying in 2nd year. Last year with a lot of expectations and ambitions I joined IIT madras. With great despair I would like to tell you that I have not yet seen my campus.
From this semester onwards our college has started conducting lab sessions online and this is affecting our academics. Since most of the students are already vaccinated with both the doses, and the covid cases have come down and hence the government won't need hostels, please reopen the campus. This will facilitate the labs, projects and extra-curricular activities.
Thanking you
With regards

19/08/2021, 20:35 - Raunak P: Idk 😂😂😂
19/08/2021, 20:35 - Harisankar K J: No one cares ig 😂
19/08/2021, 20:36 - Raunak P: Bruhhh, it's not a guitar,
19/08/2021, 20:36 - Raunak P: If you look closely, it's a harmonium
19/08/2021, 20:36 - Raunak P: Lmao 😂
19/08/2021, 20:36 - Harisankar K J: Does she play it good tho?
19/08/2021, 20:37 - Raunak P: She plays very well

19/08/2021, 20:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: Her dressup seems like an anime cosplay
19/08/2021, 20:37 - Nipun EE: Is this halcyon??
19/08/2021, 20:37 - Harisankar K J: Wth 😂
19/08/2021, 20:44 - Harisankar K J: Wth is that?
19/08/2021, 20:47 - Nipun EE: She does anime ost piano covers
19/08/2021, 20:47 - Nipun EE: I think I've seen her do this cosplay but I'm hella unsure 😳
19/08/2021, 21:13 - Aishwarya: fellas i know this is a tough question, but what does it mean if you have fever, cough and throat pain while the rest of your family have covid😀
19/08/2021, 21:15 - Harisankar K J: This message was deleted
19/08/2021, 21:15 - Nipun EE: You ask a tough answer 😔
19/08/2021, 21:16 - Harisankar K J: Not covid that's sure
19/08/2021, 21:31 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Test came back negative?
19/08/2021, 21:46 - Ashita Anil: Maybe a false negative
19/08/2021, 21:46 - Ashita Anil: U cant be sure
19/08/2021, 21:46 - Aishwarya: turns out that was antigen test not rt pcr and that's only 70% conclusive it seems
19/08/2021, 21:47 - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
19/08/2021, 21:49 - Ishaan Agarwal: it has 98+% specificity, but 60-70% sensitivity.
19/08/2021, 21:49 - Ishaan Agarwal: so, false negatives are VERY rare.
19/08/2021, 21:50 - Aishwarya: im getting rtpcr tomorrow but now that i have clear symptoms it seems obvious
19/08/2021, 21:51 - Ishaan Agarwal: after RAT negative, an RT PCR is pointless, but since you're having symptoms, the percentages seem to lie.
19/08/2021, 21:54 - Manomukil T: Exception bhai
19/08/2021, 21:54 - Manomukil T: Exception
19/08/2021, 21:55 - Aishwarya: hmm my mom said they do both in case of patients about to do surgery because antigen does go wrong a lot but you'll get the results faster
19/08/2021, 21:55 - Jayanth B: Yo
19/08/2021, 21:55 - Jayanth B: Va da
19/08/2021, 21:55 - Manomukil T: Ok
19/08/2021, 21:56 - Ishaan Agarwal: yeah, in antigen, false positives are pretty high.
19/08/2021, 21:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: Did you have symptoms when you did the test initially?
19/08/2021, 21:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: Maybe you were still in incubation?
19/08/2021, 21:58 - Aishwarya: that is very possible considering both my parents were positive
19/08/2021, 22:09 - Rushill Bairavan: Covid
19/08/2021, 22:10 - Rushill Bairavan: Take care
19/08/2021, 22:10 - Rushill Bairavan: Of your cat
19/08/2021, 22:11 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: I heard a few cases like this, a negative in a family full of positives, but based on your symptoms I suggest you take the same treatment you parents got.
19/08/2021, 22:11 - Rushill Bairavan: And maybe yourself
19/08/2021, 22:12 - Nipun EE: But honestly biggest tell tale is loss of smell and taste
19/08/2021, 22:12 - Nipun EE: If you don't have that, _maybe_ you're lucky
19/08/2021, 22:18 - Soham Roy: dengue

21/08/2021, 00:24 - Jayanth B: Go read
21/08/2021, 00:24 - Jayanth B: .
21/08/2021, 00:24 - Soham Roy: read first 30 pages of this 
feeling blessed 🙏
21/08/2021, 00:25 - Soumyadeep Kar: Niceee
21/08/2021, 00:25 - Ria Ann: There are a few caveats here. 

Firstly, they way you defined the derivative only holds true for C and not R^2, because division by ∆z a complex number, is well defined . 

Keeping that in mind, there's nothing wrong with what you derived; in fact the contradiction is resolved when you have f_x = f_y = 0. That is, you have basically discovered this result: if f: C --> R is analytic, then f has to be a constant function. 

Now if you interpret the function as going from R^2 to R, then this definition of derivative has to be changed because dividing by a vector is not defined, so essentially the definition is weakened. The total derivative is a matrix (here 1×2) , and the partial derivatives are real. 

In summary, when you look at differentiability, complex derivative is much stronger than differentiability from R^2  to R^2 because of the additional structure that is division
21/08/2021, 00:25 - Ria Ann: you read
21/08/2021, 00:25 - Soumyadeep Kar: Damn, dude you guys are hyping this to much

21/08/2021, 10:54 - Snehitha Andapally: ++++

21/08/2021, 10:54 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Jio significantly affected the market everywhere, from mobile data to fibernet. They only introduced unlimited data with reasonable speed

21/08/2021, 10:55 - Ashita Anil: <Media omitted>
21/08/2021, 10:55 - Bijo John: Bruh
21/08/2021, 10:55 - Rushill Bairavan: I don't think anyone uses mobile data predominantly there
21/08/2021, 10:55 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Three months 2 gb per day in airtel
21/08/2021, 10:55 - Bijo John: 2.4k for 1 yr 2gb/day

21/08/2021, 10:56 - Soham Roy: earning 1 USD there earns you less stuff than earning 70 INR here
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Bijo John: Afaik airtel doesn't have such a plan
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Manomukil T: Which one?
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: Ahh okay works
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Bijo John: Airtel
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Snehitha Andapally: 🙂I just calculated for one year
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Manomukil T: I say go postpaid
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: But smaller ones like monthly or quarterly is v expensive
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: No
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Postpaid is costly. I thought of changing but I saw the rates
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Bijo John: 2.5 actually

21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: Yeah 2498
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Even then not worth it
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Soham Roy: this is the approximate highest packages every year, you could argue that guys who go to US are better, in which case 1.2 cr pakage is overestimate
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Bijo John: Effective for family plan only
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: Even ill change to yearly
21/08/2021, 10:57 - Ashita Anil: Best
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Snehitha Andapally: Costs around inr560 for 56days
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Bijo John: Else absolute loss
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Bijo John: Ah like that
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: 3 sims, 999 per month da
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Jayanth B: For somw reason I don't do this thinking I might die within the next year
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Bijo John: But you don't need wifi
21/08/2021, 10:58 - Raunak P: 450 rs - 40 mbps unlimited

21/08/2021, 10:58 - Rushill Bairavan: <Media omitted>

21/08/2021, 11:00 - Bijo John: It doesn't
21/08/2021, 11:00 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: VIP is waste imo. Better go with premium is you are interested
21/08/2021, 11:00 - Bijo John: Oh, you're using postpaid?

21/08/2021, 11:01 - Bijo John: I thought carryover was there for all postpaid ones. Only for Airtel, is it?

24/08/2021, 10:05 - Jayanth B: And these reactive fields are not considered as losses right?
24/08/2021, 10:09 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Total energy = (energy flown + energy lost)+j(energy stored)
24/08/2021, 10:09 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: So yes ig
24/08/2021, 10:10 - Jayanth B: Ah okay
24/08/2021, 11:27 - Nipun EE: Which book?

24/08/2021, 13:00 - Jayanth B: Tsunami vara pogudhuuu
24/08/2021, 13:00 - Nipun EE: So he went from memory to avr instead of ALU, and now that he's in ALU its back to avr
24/08/2021, 13:00 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
24/08/2021, 13:02 - Ishaan Agarwal: ALU is a part of AVR isn't it?
24/08/2021, 13:06 - Nipun EE: Noo ALU is part of the abstract model of a computer
24/08/2021, 13:06 - Nipun EE: Avr is just sir's favorite - miCrOpRoCessOr
24/08/2021, 13:07 - Ishaan Agarwal: ALU is part of every computer right?
24/08/2021, 13:07 - Ishaan Agarwal: It's just arithmetic logic unit
24/08/2021, 13:08 - Ishaan Agarwal: I think sir was teaching AVR's ALU

24/08/2021, 14:09 - Nipun EE: We are all intelligent but some are just pros at exams 😳😳
24/08/2021, 14:09 - Jayanth B: Writing is. Studying ain't
24/08/2021, 14:09 - Ashita Anil: oof

saurav had told me that in first year, he only kept on studying and skipped so many meals
24/08/2021, 14:10 - Jayanth B: When I first joined Fiitjee I was dying. Couldn't keep up. Had to work super hard to get par with the class
24/08/2021, 14:10 - Ashita Anil: that he fell sick
24/08/2021, 14:10 - Ishaan Agarwal: F.R.I.E.N.D.S?
24/08/2021, 14:10 - Bijo John: I always get sidetracked when I'm learning stuff, so it's difficult to actually maintain focus while learning

24/08/2021, 14:11 - Ashita Anil: +++++++
24/08/2021, 14:11 - Manomukil T: Even AMS i heard... he skipped all meals for some 2 days and fell sick

24/08/2021, 14:11 - Bijo John: Saurav is INSANE level dedicated
24/08/2021, 14:11 - Bijo John: But now it's dying off
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Jayanth B: It can even get toxic for himself
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Ashita Anil: u think

24/08/2021, 14:12 - Ashita Anil: he was depressed for a few days
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Manomukil T: Do u guys think we would have studying our asses off if insti had said that we had BC?
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: ++ I find it annoying tbh. I just do what I like now a days.
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yesssss

24/08/2021, 14:12 - Ashita Anil: i wouldnt :)
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Navin EE: I wouldn't hv for sure
24/08/2021, 14:12 - Bijo John: Unlikely, CS didn't really interest me that much
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Ria Ann: if we had what now
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Ashita Anil: +++++
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Navin EE: ++

24/08/2021, 14:13 - Jayanth B: I like elec
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Nipun EE: No more of that bs
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Jayanth B: Don't want to go cs
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yes sir, on your designed path only.
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Bijo John: AMS is just binging
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Soham Roy: I have heard the movie doesn't do anywhere close to justice to the book

24/08/2021, 14:13 - Parth Arora: Yeah it's pretty shit xD
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Parth Arora: Compared to shining at least
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Jayanth B: And and and graduating with girlfriend/boyfriend
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Nipun EE: Yusss
24/08/2021, 14:13 - Ashita Anil: do u think abt it
24/08/2021, 14:14 - Ria Ann: i thought studying would be the side thing we had to do
24/08/2021, 14:14 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yudodis. I don't wanna continue watching now.🙂
24/08/2021, 14:14 - Ashita Anil: <Media omitted>

24/08/2021, 14:14 - Navin EE: I thought I'll bunk acads completely and do sports and pursue other hobbies..but here I am
24/08/2021, 14:14 - Ishaan Agarwal: ~and studying too~

24/08/2021, 14:14 - Raunak P: That's kinda what I want
24/08/2021, 14:14 - Ashita Anil: but is it hto

24/08/2021, 14:14 - Nipun EE: Idts 😔 not if you want 9+
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Ria Ann: get a wig as your new gig
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Bijo John: It would've created a toxic atmosphere in most branches. But CS and EE are unlikely to be significantly hit
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Do what the heart says, even if it says trim it all
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Ashita Anil: then why r u people so worried abt others studying for 10hrs a day
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Jayanth B: 8.5+ is enough no

24/08/2021, 14:15 - Navin EE: Dai u already bald
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Ishaan Agarwal: I actually find it weird that people care about acads so much, and I kinda feel like I'm peer pressured into caring about acads.
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Soham Roy: From what I've heard among all IITs, people focus on acads the most here
24/08/2021, 14:15 - Ria Ann: this
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Nipun EE: All of u have higher cg 🦄
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Jayanth B: No I'm not. Stop judging me with my family background
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Bijo John: Bruh wut... you prolly need 9.8 or so to get to CS
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Jayanth B: I have more hair density tahn u
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Ashita Anil: i tho definitely am
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Navin EE: Yea exactly. Hv to fight the peer pressure. Let's fail together 🫂
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Ashita Anil: u have 9+ -_-
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Manomukil T: Heres where bijos point make sense

24/08/2021, 14:16 - Navin EE: Ur density is non uniform ma. That hole in the middle..
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😂😂😂 I just wanna stay decent in acads. Not fail and all 😂
24/08/2021, 14:16 - Raunak P: <Media omitted>
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Bijo John: Nope, as I said I'm not interested in the life of a coder

24/08/2021, 14:17 - Jayanth B: 9.9 I think
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Uncle jayanth
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Navin EE: I'm pretty sure we still consider C,B as fail only
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Raunak P: Cs is coding uh?
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Raunak P: Only coding?
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Bijo John: ++
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Ishaan Agarwal: I do 10 hours a week. Maybe.
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Ashita Anil: oof
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Nipun EE: ++ I just want 8.5+ but 4 years of me doing stuff I want
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Bijo John: Ig
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Manomukil T: A bit of data science too i think
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Raunak P: I thought that fell under non core software profiles
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Nipun EE: Nahh depends on what u do
24/08/2021, 14:17 - Bijo John: For CS, that is core
24/08/2021, 14:18 - Ashita Anil: what do u want to do
ur cg is what 8.75 uh
24/08/2021, 14:18 - Bijo John: For elec, it is non core

24/08/2021, 14:18 - Ashita Anil: <Media omitted>
24/08/2021, 14:18 - Navin EE: Tbf if we accumulate 9.5+ cg now we can burn it in first sem offline by bunking acads then. Assuming ofc we do go offline
24/08/2021, 14:18 - Bijo John: Lol😂
24/08/2021, 14:18 - Nipun EE: 😂😂 all family members like that only

24/08/2021, 19:59 - Nipun EE: my theory:
d2V/dx2 is proportional to V, so the voltage curve at maxima will be steeper than at the minima
so if the probe misses the real maxima by a small distance, the error in Vmax will be larger than if the same happened in Vmin

24/08/2021, 23:39 - Manomukil T: coz i  dont believe in relationships
24/08/2021, 23:39 - Jayanth B: Whyy
24/08/2021, 23:40 - Kushagra Agrawal: Yeah everyone says that before they get into s relationship
24/08/2021, 23:40 - Manomukil T: i feel friendships is better
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Bijo John: Honestly, imo 99% of gf-bf relationships are not gonna lead to a life together
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Kushagra Agrawal: Yes but also no
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Manomukil T: my man
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Jayanth B: Relationship is also like a friendship only. It's just a bit more exclusive
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Bijo John: Mostly just for the experience and maybe bragging rights
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Kushagra Agrawal: Bcoz 90% are to get sex
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Kushagra Agrawal: ++
24/08/2021, 23:41 - Manomukil T: fuck exclusive
24/08/2021, 23:42 - Bijo John: This 'exclusive' part bums me out, like you don't get sufficient return to make that level of exclusiveness worthwhile
24/08/2021, 23:42 - Manomukil T: just normal friendship is enough where u dont get too possessive and give each other the reqd space
24/08/2021, 23:42 - Jayanth B: Friendship also you can get possesive
24/08/2021, 23:42 - Bijo John: Not to mention all the drama and restraint
24/08/2021, 23:43 - Manomukil T: Not if ur a gang
24/08/2021, 23:43 - Manomukil T: The minute u get they will bring u back down to normality
24/08/2021, 23:44 - Manomukil T: Look these are just my views and i do not claim it to work for everyone
24/08/2021, 23:44 - Manomukil T: I just dont see the fact that relationships will work out for me
24/08/2021, 23:44 - Manomukil T: And these are my reasons so
24/08/2021, 23:44 - Manomukil T: Nanri vanakkam
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Parth Arora: what have you gone through sir
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Bijo John: Whistle podu
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Kushagra Agrawal: Mano after 3 months be like : 
_Ohh I am in love_
_Ohh relationships are the best_
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Jayanth B: Lol
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Manomukil T: I  have been saying this since i joined insti
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Manomukil T: Prolly i will feel for some 2-3 mins ngl but it will fade off quickly
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Ashita Anil: Varun was exactly like thus
24/08/2021, 23:45 - Ashita Anil: Till he met his girlfriend
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Jayanth B: What will you say if a girl says she has a major crush on u
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Manomukil T: that i can guarantee
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Ashita Anil: Then wham bam
2years ma'am
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Manomukil T: sorry but i dont feel the same
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Jayanth B: By wham bam u mean....
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Manomukil T: lets just remain friends
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Jayanth B: You're saying you don't believe in love or relationship?
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Bijo John: Crushes are just infatuation
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Bijo John: Way too different from love
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Ashita Anil: No
24/08/2021, 23:46 - Manomukil T: For me definition of love itself is different
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Ashita Anil: I like that phrase
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: Bro mano
U should try everything
That includes trying to be in a relationship
It is okay if it doesn't work out
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Bijo John: 😳
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Jayanth B: I'll make sure it's on your eulogy
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: But u can't say it is bad without even trying it
24/08/2021, 23:47 - Kushagra Agrawal: Bcoz u don't know the feeling
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Bijo John: Eyy he doesn't even like the concept, why add bad memories to him and someone else? Ofc, it's a different tale if it happens naturally
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Ashita Anil: But if you're in a stable relationship, it is much better than friendship imo
Where u grow and support each other and are always there for each other
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Manomukil T: ok even lets say i try.... i fall in love.... waste a lot of resources maintaining relationships and in the end it doesnt work out
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Ashita Anil: Thats the best one
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Navin EE: Yo yo hold up. R u crazy? Hv u seen little women?
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Ashita Anil: 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Jayanth B: 😞
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Manomukil T: Then what abt the resources i used
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Ashita Anil: I've read it
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Ashita Anil: 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Manomukil T: I dont think i will be able to manage that and if i keep some personal goals
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Manomukil T: Again thats my view
24/08/2021, 23:48 - Bijo John: Don't objectify it 😬
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Jayanth B: First of all nobody expects you to use "resources" in a non toxic relationship
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Kushagra Agrawal: Its fine then
U don't have to end up marrying the person for a successful relationship

By that logic u wouldn't even believe in marriage
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Manomukil T: ok ok
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Bijo John: I get your point, but don't speak of resources anol
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Manomukil T: by resources i mean time
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Ashita Anil: @919840716516 @917034204556
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Manomukil T: and opportunites
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Ashita Anil: Do u ask ur friends for something in return when u spend time with them
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Ashita Anil: Then why here
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Jayanth B: Yeah well it's worth it while it lasts
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Kushagra Agrawal: I didn't say sacrifice ur career and all for it😐
24/08/2021, 23:49 - Bijo John: I don't see how that's better than a friendship, and such things just happen, you don't force it to happen imo
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Manomukil T: but what if it goes to that extent
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Kushagra Agrawal: Then choose ur career
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Ashita Anil: Then somethings wrong
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Ashita Anil: It is
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Ashita Anil: Ask jaya aunt
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Bijo John: ?
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Jayanth B: 😞
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Ashita Anil: Jayant
24/08/2021, 23:50 - Bijo John: Ah
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Manomukil T: if im too blind to recognize it
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Manomukil T: being too optimistic making it work and all
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Manomukil T: and yet fail
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Ashita Anil: Okay pa
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Ashita Anil: Leave
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Manomukil T: im not willing to take that risk
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Ashita Anil: Start single
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Bijo John: How would a single person be better than many
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Kushagra Agrawal: Hey btw nobody telling u to get in a relationship right away
I am just saying that don't deny the opportunity bcoz u hv some misconception abt it
24/08/2021, 23:51 - Ashita Anil: If u find the right person 
Then definitely
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Manomukil T: Then back to the same point... what's the difference between friendship and relationship?
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Bijo John: Finding the right person depends a lot on luck, and even more luck to get involved with them
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Jayanth B: You bring out the best versions of both of you. Obviously you'll have fallouts and all but then at the end of the day you know the other person is going to be there anyways
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Jayanth B: You believe in soulmates?
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Ashita Anil: No but
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ahh
How can I explain it.
It is not something u can define
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Bijo John: Yes, but I don't believe in my odds of finding one
24/08/2021, 23:52 - Ashita Anil: Teri nazaron mei
........
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ashita Anil: Whats the use of marrying some random woman
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ruthika: Who wants to binge read microprocessors with me :)
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Kushagra Agrawal: There are many right persons.
There is no made for each other
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ashita Anil: Lessgo
Im in 2.3 page 64
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Manomukil T: From which lec?
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ria Ann: i know this is right, but i find this so hard to accept
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Soham Roy: Similar level to Purvam speaking against friendships
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ruthika: I'm in 1.1 but ok 🥲
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ruthika: I said read
24/08/2021, 23:53 - Ashita Anil: To mate uh
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ashita Anil: 😑😑😑😑😑
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Manomukil T: Which book which chap?
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ik right
There is always a fear
That what if he/she is not the right person
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Bijo John: True, and a relationship is like an experiment. I don't like to joke with my life
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ria Ann: i straight started from 2, jump
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ruthika: Doesn't matter pa just stay on call and do your work I'll do mine
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Manomukil T: Agreeable ngl
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Bijo John: Ignore 1.1 and 1.2
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ashita Anil: :)
Date enjoy 
If not right 
Then move on
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Manomukil T: K join vc
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ashita Anil: What's wrong with that
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ashita Anil: Nothing is
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ruthika: Cool
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Jayanth B: Take even the current scenario. You're here talking to us rather than studying or doing something. Why? Because maybe talking here gives you a peace of mind, you're stress free and maybe even happy
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ahh it isn't an experiment
It is as good as watching television .
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ruthika: Really uh
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Ria Ann: but then what if you're not trying enough
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Kushagra Agrawal: ++
24/08/2021, 23:54 - Bijo John: Yes
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ashita Anil: Then try enough?
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Manomukil T: Correctu
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ruthika: Pg 44- smth was in week 4's reading assignment too
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ruthika: That's in 1.2
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ashita Anil: Chapter 2 is beautiful 
Ull enjoy it
Read it alone imo
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ria Ann: move on shouldn't be that easy an option
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Ria Ann: maybe
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Jayanth B: Is this some erotica
24/08/2021, 23:55 - Bijo John: A date behaves differently once status becomes 'lover' and yet again differently when they become 'life partner'
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Ashita Anil: It isnt an easy option at all
But its the best u can do at that situation
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Bijo John: The issue is that expectations may occur
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Manomukil T: Conclusion @917708305069 ?
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Kushagra Agrawal: So u gonna die a virgin?
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Ria Ann: at which stage can you stick your foot up a face
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Ria Ann: i want that stage
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Jayanth B: Un vaazhkai un ishtam
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Ashita Anil: Thats the level of comfort
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Soham Roy: The sooner you tell them about your foot fetish, the better
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Ashita Anil: Its beautiful
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Manomukil T: Thanks nanba
24/08/2021, 23:56 - Jayanth B: 🙏
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Kushagra Agrawal: Soham sir pls share ur expert experiences

24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ashita Anil: <Media omitted>
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Kushagra Agrawal: Now that's experimenting with life😂
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Bijo John: I'm gonna go for it if I believe I found the one for me, with the intent to marry, and only after I've properly settled in a job. Else, I'd go for arranged marriage
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ashita Anil: Exactly
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ria Ann: this is it
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ria Ann: yes
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ashita Anil: No

24/08/2021, 23:57 - Ashita Anil: Become pan
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Bijo John: Arranged marriage doesn't carry as many expectations as love marriages
24/08/2021, 23:57 - Manomukil T: This message was deleted
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Soham Roy: It's not thaaat different from a friendship
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Kushagra Agrawal: Girl to bijo : Hey, what ya doing!
Bijo : Will u marry me?
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Ashita Anil: Its the best way of life😌
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Jayanth B: What's pan
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Ria Ann: peter?
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Bijo John: Coz you don't know anything, you don't expect too much, or atleast it's acceptable if your expectation isn't met
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Soham Roy: bruh that's like saying i'll never eat restaurant food coz i might not like the food there
24/08/2021, 23:58 - Kushagra Agrawal: Now that is a way to dir virgin

24/08/2021, 23:58 - Ashita Anil: Isnt life abt expectations and thrill
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Bijo John: Nah the investment is different
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Jayanth B: Isn't that bi
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Ria Ann: no bi is restricted to the two
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Ashita Anil: Random woman ull marry and what if she has a secret lover
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Ria Ann: i believe
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Navin EE: Bi is liking both genitalia. Pan is not liking any genitalia
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Ashita Anil: Then life paaya pochu
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Kushagra Agrawal: If there are not sad and regrettable moments in life then what is the point of it

Ur life can't be perfect
U would get bored of u didn't face rejection or break ups
24/08/2021, 23:59 - Jayanth B: Oh damn

Adventure Club


From expanding our horizons to enhancing our mental health and learning new strengths, adventure sports have an overflowing basket of benefits to provide. To actualize the same, Adventure Club is at your doorstep with a series of events, and if this strange time permits, some exciting treks and cycling trips. Sitting at home since the pandemic hit us has almost made us forget what thrill feels like, and we intend to change the same. 



If you’ve ever wanted to sit under a starry sky on a hill-top, relive Bunny from YJHD getting crazy about treks, convert that flow of adrenaline after a good workout regime into an exhilarating experience, or simply enjoy the thrills of life and put your fitness to good use, Adventure club is your go-to place. Remember- enthusiasm, guts, and fitness are all you need to be a part of our activities. We dare, we conquer. Come, dare to join us!!

28/08/2021, 17:03 - Bijo John: None of these are scary
28/08/2021, 17:04 - Raunak P: Arranged marriages are scary, what if on suhagraat you find out that it's a snake instead of a kitty?
28/08/2021, 17:05 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 17:06 - Soham Roy: those are jokes

28/08/2021, 17:07 - Soham Roy: not everyone has a voice like ashita's or today's experimenter's 😂
28/08/2021, 17:07 - Bijo John: What if you do a love marriage, only to find that things are no longer the same?
28/08/2021, 17:07 - Bijo John: Imo this is worse
28/08/2021, 17:07 - Raunak P: Lmaooo
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Raunak P: You stick to arranged marriage only bro
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Raunak P: Love and all you can leave
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Bijo John: Also it's not like I'm against love marriages or anything, what I don't like is the idea of hunting for gfs
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Raunak P: That's what arranged marriage does 😂😂😂
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Bijo John: I hate things that aren't completely sincere
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Raunak P: Well gfs = wives
28/08/2021, 17:08 - Bijo John: Bruh there's no relationship till you marry
28/08/2021, 17:09 - Raunak P: Everyone hates that
28/08/2021, 17:09 - Bijo John: So no commitment
28/08/2021, 17:09 - Ishaan Agarwal: Wdym by completely sincere?
28/08/2021, 17:09 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😂😂😂 gg. Nice callback
28/08/2021, 17:10 - Bijo John: A relationship should be with the intention of marriage and being together forever imo, not to 'see if things work out'
28/08/2021, 17:10 - Ishaan Agarwal: You say this to a girl and you aren't getting laid.
28/08/2021, 17:11 - Ria Ann: you see, that's not what he's in it for
28/08/2021, 17:11 - Ria Ann: good job bijo
28/08/2021, 17:11 - Ishaan Agarwal: But what if things don't work out? Would you still stay with the "being together forever" motto.
28/08/2021, 17:11 - Rushill Bairavan: He won't get to be in it
28/08/2021, 17:11 - Ria Ann: i surrender
28/08/2021, 17:12 - Rushill Bairavan: Here, it refers to ...
28/08/2021, 17:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: Not only that, nobody would wanna be in a relationship where a guy is so very committed to being together forever. Atleast that's what I think.
28/08/2021, 17:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: It honestly creeps me out
28/08/2021, 17:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Get set up by your parents, meet a girl twice or thrice and spend the rest of your life with her? IT'S SCARY.
28/08/2021, 17:13 - Bijo John: You're denying every single arranged marriage in the country
28/08/2021, 17:13 - Ria Ann: it is, it is, but give it time and well, maybe
28/08/2021, 17:13 - Ria Ann: just maybe
28/08/2021, 17:14 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why force yourself to be compatible after marriage when you can do the same before getting married?
28/08/2021, 17:14 - Bijo John: Coz the effort involved is way too much
28/08/2021, 17:14 - Bijo John: And so is the disappointment at every failure
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Bijo John: And the odds ain't nice too
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Raunak P: Hmmm
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Ishaan Agarwal: Okay I would love to discuss further, but these kids want me to play cricket, so I GTG.
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Raunak P: So bijo if a girl you like asks you out
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Raunak P: What will you do
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Raunak P: Hit a six from my side bro ❤️
28/08/2021, 17:15 - Ishaan Agarwal: Sure bro ❤️
28/08/2021, 17:16 - Bijo John: Same, gotta go get a haircut

28/08/2021, 17:17 - Navin EE: "Ishaan anna, seekram vaanga anna" 😂
28/08/2021, 17:17 - Raunak P: Would you marry her
28/08/2021, 17:17 - Raunak P: Say in 2 years
28/08/2021, 17:26 - Rushill Bairavan: "vandhu team edunga na"
28/08/2021, 17:28 - Bijo John: Possibly, but I definitely won't deliberately try to develop it into a relationship like that
28/08/2021, 17:32 - Jayanth B: Ishaan joker da

28/08/2021, 18:34 - Snehitha Andapally: Are ur parents against to it or smth?
28/08/2021, 18:35 - Bijo John: Probably, didn't talk about stuff like that, but I would be able to convince them

28/08/2021, 18:38 - Bijo John: 😬 what happened

28/08/2021, 18:38 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Same maama?
28/08/2021, 18:38 - Jayanth B: Yesss
28/08/2021, 18:38 - Bijo John: Yeah if it happens on its own it's nice only
28/08/2021, 18:39 - Bijo John: Don't get the impression that I hate love or love marriages
28/08/2021, 18:39 - Ruthika: then fine only
28/08/2021, 18:39 - Bijo John: I'm just not particularly willing to invest myself in it unless I see a real chance
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Snehitha Andapally: Inter caste marriage 🐤
And, different region also, so some region issues at the beginning of their marriage life.
But I love my maama's wife🥰
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Snehitha Andapally: Mamma is mom🐤
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Ruthika: not like you're gonna understand that she's the one the moment you see her
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Bijo John: What I do hate is the concept of 'being in a relationship' without intending to be together later on
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Ruthika: duh
28/08/2021, 18:40 - Bijo John: Oh... that kinda stuff should settle, hopefully
28/08/2021, 18:41 - Bijo John: True, hence the lack of interest
28/08/2021, 18:41 - Snehitha Andapally: Yeah, it is much better now.
28/08/2021, 18:41 - Ruthika: it's not like they don't want to be together later on, they're just afraid of committing to something they aren't sure of
28/08/2021, 18:42 - Bijo John: Yeah, I wouldn't be in a relationship I'm not sure of
28/08/2021, 18:42 - Ruthika: you can never be sure of it :)
28/08/2021, 18:42 - Soham Roy: if you're actually sure then you'd be engaged, not just dating
28/08/2021, 18:42 - Bijo John: Exactly
28/08/2021, 18:42 - Jayanth B: Soham as he looks down upon us mortals -

28/08/2021, 18:43 - Bijo John: Saar you had one
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Soham Roy: he was chased away by her parents with a stick
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Jayanth B: 😓
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Read it wrong😅
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Snehitha Andapally: Lool
28/08/2021, 18:43 - Ruthika: it's not like you're gonna be together forever once you get married na
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Snehitha Andapally: Really ah👀
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Bijo John: Well, not that it will happen 100%, but you should be with the intention of making it happen, not try it out. Well this is my viewpoint
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Snehitha Andapally: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Jayanth B: Not literally but yeah
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Bijo John: It is, for the most part atleast. Exceptions do exist
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Ruthika: that you can do by being in a relationship also :)
28/08/2021, 18:44 - Harisankar K J: How do you 'know' if it's arranged
28/08/2021, 18:45 - Bijo John: It being arranged automatically implies both parties are willing (theoretically)
28/08/2021, 18:45 - Harisankar K J: But how do YOU know?
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Bijo John: Again, I don't hate relationships, what I hate is the scramble for one
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Bijo John: ?
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Ruthika: well so your point is you get an arranged marriage and then you try your best to make things workout
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Ruthika: ?
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Harisankar K J: Oh ok nvm
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Bijo John: Yeah
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Soham Roy: My FIITJEE classmate had an arranged marriage in JoSAA choice filling
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Harisankar K J: What?!
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Soham Roy: he had his elder brother and dad put all preferences for him coz he didn't want to put effort and later regret
28/08/2021, 18:46 - Nipun EE: Lmao ssme

28/08/2021, 18:47 - Snehitha Andapally: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:47 - Ruthika: how about you find someone you really like and you try to do the same with her, except that the marriage part comes later
28/08/2021, 18:47 - Soham Roy: doing Maths n Computing in Kanpur rn
28/08/2021, 18:47 - Nipun EE: Lmao
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Nipun EE: Everyone trying to make hypothetical cases for bijo
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Harisankar K J: Oh ok

28/08/2021, 18:48 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Ruthika: lol
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Soham Roy: he didn't want to go to the trouble and end up years later realising he made a bad choice
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Bijo John: 1. Find the one
2. Be successful in doing the same
3. Be prepared for things to be different once you're married
Not that easy
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Soham Roy: this way he can focus on just making it work 😂
28/08/2021, 18:48 - Ruthika: yeah we don't want him to grind too
28/08/2021, 18:49 - Bijo John: Yeah, don't wanna invest myself
28/08/2021, 18:49 - Bijo John: Atleast till I have a decent job
28/08/2021, 18:49 - Ruthika: oh so you think things remain the same with your future arranged wife?
28/08/2021, 18:50 - Bijo John: No, but there's less of an impact, and 1) and 2) are nulled
28/08/2021, 18:50 - Soham Roy: i have a terrible yet brilliant analogy
an arranged marriage is like going to a restaurant and asking for the waiter's recommendation instead of reading descriptions in the menu and ordering from what you think the dish would be like
28/08/2021, 18:50 - Soham Roy: grinding is fun tho 👀
28/08/2021, 18:50 - Bijo John: 🥴
28/08/2021, 18:51 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Ruthika: i don't understand
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Bijo John: Also, take all of my opinions with a pinch of salt, might be coz of low self esteem lol
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: 😂😂 🫂
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Soham Roy: From what I have seen, people don't really change for the worse, they stop liking each other much so they lose their inherent bias and start seeing the truth :P
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Ruthika: ok you don't want to put in efforts cuz they might be futile in future?
28/08/2021, 18:52 - Bijo John: Exactly
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Soham Roy: you find for him and prove him wrong na
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Soham Roy: why berate him
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Bijo John: Most important point is that I don't wanna deal with a rejection, especially at this stage of life
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Bijo John: All other things are okay
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:53 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Brilliant. You have to take the gamble👌. But here the dish can adjust itself too
28/08/2021, 18:54 - Ruthika: wait wouldn't finding for him be arranged too
28/08/2021, 18:54 - Bijo John: My views might be different a few years later
28/08/2021, 18:54 - Bijo John: Setting me up ain't arranged 😳
28/08/2021, 18:54 - Ruthika: yeee
28/08/2021, 18:55 - Soham Roy: yes but friends arranging by meeting the girl is a step from parents arranging by meeting parents of the girl
28/08/2021, 18:55 - Ruthika: ok i can't guarantee you happy marriage yes
28/08/2021, 18:56 - Ruthika: ok agreed that rejection is bad but but what about all those happy moments
28/08/2021, 18:56 - Soham Roy: Very much so. Hunan Chicken at Mainland China is sublime but the usual less exorbitant restaurants don't make it well. On the other hand, even a roadside chinese takeaway makes good Chili Chicken whereas Mainland's is meh even  ignoring the price.
28/08/2021, 18:57 - Shrey Shah: Damn intense life discussions
28/08/2021, 18:57 - Shrey Shah: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 18:57 - Harisankar K J: I would say that any kind of marriage is a gamble... arranged marriage is a low risk(according to statistics) and the result cannot be predicted but is proven to be pretty stable and love marriage is a a high risk high reward kinda situation.
And I think....something which lasts longer does not mean it's a good relationship.
28/08/2021, 18:57 - Bijo John: Not much of a temporary happiness kinda guy, I prolly won't be able to look back at those memories with a smile
28/08/2021, 18:58 - Bijo John: I'm a very emotional person, if you guys haven't noticed it already. Stuff like rejection would prolly mess me up for quite a long while
28/08/2021, 18:59 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Getting Rama vibes here
28/08/2021, 18:59 - Ruthika: aiyo😂
28/08/2021, 18:59 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/08/2021, 19:00 - Ruthika: it maybe not be rejection always, it can be a mutual breakup too :)
28/08/2021, 19:01 - Bijo John: Yeah the pain is similar
28/08/2021, 19:01 - Nipun EE: At the end of the day, you need luck saar
28/08/2021, 19:01 - Ruthika: ah why do you even want to think about breaking up
28/08/2021, 19:01 - Nipun EE: With luck, it can all be beauotufl

28/08/2021, 22:00 - Ruthika: Why can't everyone take poison 🙂
28/08/2021, 22:00 - Ruthika: Why slit throats 🙂
28/08/2021, 22:00 - Soham Roy: He does give those vibes but I don't think he'll ever
28/08/2021, 22:00 - Ruthika: Did he not have money to buy two poison bottles
28/08/2021, 22:01 - Soham Roy: apparently not, considering his wife survived
28/08/2021, 22:01 - Ruthika: F
28/08/2021, 22:04 - Ashita Anil: Why kill kids?
28/08/2021, 22:04 - Ashita Anil: Bruh
28/08/2021, 22:04 - Ruthika: Kids gonna have hard time
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Ashita Anil: So kill uh
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Ruthika: Idk
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Ruthika: But poison be better than slitting throats
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Bijo John: Someone thinking of suicide is clearly not thinking straight, so such arguments need not work
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Ruthika: Ok I'm out
28/08/2021, 22:05 - Ashita Anil: But those 2 can die and put kids to orphanage
28/08/2021, 22:06 - Ruthika: Idk idk
28/08/2021, 22:06 - Manomukil T: Ensuring they don't survive by chance🙂
28/08/2021, 22:07 - Ruthika: But that girl survived 🙂
28/08/2021, 22:07 - Ruthika: Now it's worse 🙂
28/08/2021, 22:08 - Manomukil T: Lemme rephrase.. decreasing chances of survival
28/08/2021, 22:08 - Manomukil T: Depends on how she takes it
28/08/2021, 22:08 - Ruthika: Ugh it's messed up
28/08/2021, 22:09 - Ruthika: How could he get himself to kill his own children
28/08/2021, 22:09 - Ishaan Agarwal: Isn't living a life with no parents, no money worse?
28/08/2021, 22:11 - Ashita Anil: Not really
28/08/2021, 22:11 - Ashita Anil: But its better than being kied
28/08/2021, 22:11 - Ashita Anil: *killed
28/08/2021, 22:11 - Ruthika: Or rather he could've realised that what he's doing isn't right and then decide to try looking for a job instead and somehow surviving
28/08/2021, 22:11 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😳
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: Agreed.
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ruthika: It's not that hard to survive
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ashita Anil: Bruh
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ashita Anil: Bruh
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ruthika: And he's a frickin engineering
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ruthika: Engineer*
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: But if he and his wife are dying, putting their kids through that torture isn't right.
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ruthika: What
28/08/2021, 22:12 - Ruthika: It's not
28/08/2021, 22:13 - Ashita Anil: How can u tell this ma
28/08/2021, 22:13 - Ruthika: Hein
28/08/2021, 22:13 - Ashita Anil: If it wasnt that hard to survive lakhs of ppl wouldn't have died
28/08/2021, 22:13 - Ashita Anil: It is the survival of the fittest
28/08/2021, 22:14 - Ashita Anil: Hopefully not yet
28/08/2021, 22:14 - Ruthika: It's not :)
28/08/2021, 22:14 - Ruthika: Hard
28/08/2021, 22:14 - Soham Roy: you can't go to surviving on a 10k per month job after having a say 50k per month job, he'd probably have an emi or other loans of 20k per month alone
28/08/2021, 22:14 - Ruthika: Hmmmm
28/08/2021, 22:15 - Ashita Anil: Different ppl have different breaking points
28/08/2021, 22:15 - Ashita Anil: Some ppl cry when they get A instead of S
28/08/2021, 22:15 - Ashita Anil: Meanwhile others celebrate that its A and not B
28/08/2021, 22:15 - Ruthika: 🚶🚶
28/08/2021, 22:19 - Bijo John: Sometimes death might be better than mere 'survival'
28/08/2021, 22:19 - Nipun EE: Engineer and all waste only pa
28/08/2021, 22:19 - Bijo John: Surviving and 'living' are two different things imo
28/08/2021, 22:19 - Ashita Anil: Drop out
28/08/2021, 22:20 - Bijo John: Lmao a sizable chunk of the indian unemployed population are engineers
28/08/2021, 22:20 - Nipun EE: Iit has reputation so its fine
28/08/2021, 22:20 - Nipun EE: But normal engineering clgs no one Cares
28/08/2021, 22:20 - Nipun EE: Don't immediately say xxx CLG is good, thats not my point 😑
28/08/2021, 22:20 - Ruthika: Yeahh but the karma builds up :)
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Bijo John: Not everyone believes in god or karma
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Nipun EE: But killing the kids, idk
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Ruthika: I'm not talking about this case alone
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Nipun EE: Would they have had a life of suffering, maybe. But to deny that chance at all...
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Bijo John: Yeah I don't agree to it
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Bijo John: They should not be denied the chance
28/08/2021, 22:21 - Ruthika: I'm just talking about survival and living part
28/08/2021, 22:22 - Nipun EE: But your right, if he's suicidal can't expect bulletproof logic

28/08/2021, 22:23 - Manomukil T: We can't conclude until we properly know what the guy went through and what his thoughts were
28/08/2021, 22:24 - Ruthika: They could be put to orphanages
28/08/2021, 22:24 - Bijo John: No human being is allowef to take the life of another one, no matter what. But yeah logic doesn't exactly matter here
28/08/2021, 22:24 - Manomukil T: I don't think the conditions of orphanages are good
28/08/2021, 22:25 - Manomukil T: There have cases of exploitation and all
28/08/2021, 22:25 - Ashita Anil: Bruh
28/08/2021, 22:25 - Ashita Anil: Not all r bad
28/08/2021, 22:25 - Manomukil T: To find a good one takes time na
28/08/2021, 22:25 - Manomukil T: In that way I am saying
28/08/2021, 22:26 - Ashita Anil: Better than being slit
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Bijo John: That doesn't mean the parent can decide without the child's consent
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Bijo John: For that matter, even with the child's consent it's the wrong thing to do
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Ruthika: Prolly they didn't want to go through all the struggle
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Ruthika: 🙂
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Manomukil T: If u go by this then death  penalties are wrong too
28/08/2021, 22:27 - Manomukil T: See imo can be argued from both sides🙂
28/08/2021, 22:28 - Ashita Anil: Si

29/08/2021, 14:06 - Kushagra Agrawal: Doubt.

How do we decide when to use mesh analysis and when to use nodal analysis??
29/08/2021, 14:07 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Only currents source there, nodal is pretty easy. Else you gonna have to do a mix of both
29/08/2021, 14:08 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ohhk
Thansk
29/08/2021, 14:16 - Nipun EE: Using super nodes/super mesh you can use the same for most circuits
29/08/2021, 14:18 - Bijo John: Tbh you can make either of them work, personally I prefer nodal analysis and would use mesh only if there are many voltage sources or so
29/08/2021, 14:19 - Ria Ann: also also
29/08/2021, 14:19 - Ria Ann: is the hostel fee 6992

29/08/2021, 18:53 - Jayanth B: Oh fk
29/08/2021, 18:53 - Bijo John: That's when it comes in endsem

29/08/2021, 18:55 - Ishaan Agarwal: Is it there for Quiz 1 though?
29/08/2021, 18:55 - Bijo John: And even if it does come, it's less confusing to just write the eqns and then form a matrix, rather than just write matrix directly
29/08/2021, 18:55 - Bijo John: This I'm not sure
29/08/2021, 18:55 - Bijo John: 😕

29/08/2021, 19:19 - Nipun EE: Hmmmz
29/08/2021, 19:20 - Soham Roy: They might ask us to find MNA matrix for subjective

29/08/2021, 19:22 - Raunak P: My personal doubt....
29/08/2021, 19:22 - Raunak P: How is mna different from normal na
29/08/2021, 19:22 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
29/08/2021, 19:22 - Bijo John: .
29/08/2021, 19:22 - Raunak P: Is it like adding in auxiliary currents
29/08/2021, 19:23 - Raunak P: I meant, exactly how is it different
29/08/2021, 19:23 - Raunak P: To voltage sources ?
29/08/2021, 19:25 - Nipun EE: See, you're the making the mistake of trying to understand
29/08/2021, 19:25 - Nipun EE: In IIT, thats drag
29/08/2021, 19:26 - Nipun EE: Just learn the formula, apply it, grind for S
29/08/2021, 19:29 - Raunak P: Tf is the formula here 😂😂
29/08/2021, 19:30 - Nipun EE: Good qn
29/08/2021, 19:30 - Nipun EE: I'll notify you when I get the answer
29/08/2021, 19:32 - Ishaan Agarwal: In nodal, you write equations for each node.
29/08/2021, 19:32 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
29/08/2021, 19:32 - Ishaan Agarwal: In MNA, you write stamps for each component.
29/08/2021, 19:32 - Ria Ann: i don't like that
29/08/2021, 19:32 - Bijo John: 😳
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Ishaan Agarwal: Atleast that's how it should be done, but no one obeys that.
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Bijo John: Those stamps come from the nodal eqns lol
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yes
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Nipun EE: What bro
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Raunak P: It's fine to build from the eq I hope
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Nipun EE: Why waste time
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Ishaan Agarwal: But the algorithm implies that we do it component by component.
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Raunak P: Cause ibcant remember the stamps
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Bijo John: Definitely
29/08/2021, 19:33 - Nipun EE: Just do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

29/08/2021, 20:12 - Rushill Bairavan: What matrix are you guys talking about? I read the book for nodal and mesh and the only relation to matrices I could see was when solving linear eqns
29/08/2021, 20:14 - Ishaan Agarwal: Read modified nodal.
29/08/2021, 20:14 - Rushill Bairavan: I was just about to ask that. Modified nodal is not supernodes?
29/08/2021, 20:15 - Rushill Bairavan: If not, I'll read it up
29/08/2021, 20:15 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Nope

29/08/2021, 20:17 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
29/08/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: da it all comes down to writing eq and putting matrix no
29/08/2021, 20:17 - Nipun EE: But 2015 I like lecs
29/08/2021, 20:17 - Nipun EE: Nice and ez

29/08/2021, 20:17 - Ashita Anil: Lec isn't enough uh🥲
29/08/2021, 20:17 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Because Boycott lecs
29/08/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: except that in some cases you take help of aux currents
29/08/2021, 20:18 - Ashita Anil: 👀
29/08/2021, 20:18 - Harisankar K J: That's what I thought..but the video lectures are confusing
29/08/2021, 20:18 - Nipun EE: He must be skipping lecs

29/08/2021, 21:13 - Harisankar K J: Can someone say the difference between supernode method and modified nodal analysis?
29/08/2021, 21:16 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: You don't need to specify a current for the source if you can spot a supernode
29/08/2021, 21:19 - Harisankar K J: But by specifying the current the supernode is derived right?
29/08/2021, 21:42 - Nipun EE: But by combining the two nodes between which the current exists, you remove the need to consider it
29/08/2021, 21:48 - Bijo John: It isn't there in the book ryt
29/08/2021, 21:48 - Bijo John: Apparently if you master it, guaranteed S in ee2015

29/08/2021, 21:50 - Raunak P: Modified you just add aux currents and do
29/08/2021, 21:50 - Rushill Bairavan: He's not accounting for careless mistakes
29/08/2021, 21:51 - Harisankar K J: Ohk 🙌

30/08/2021, 10:31 - Soumyadeep Kar: Respected Sir, 
With reference to the above cited subject, we would like to bring to your kind notice that “G.O. (Ms) No.522, Revenue and Disaster Management (DM-IV) Department” was released by the government of Tamil Nadu dated 21.8.2021 in concern with the Re-opening of all Higher Educational Institutions including Residential Campuses. 
According to this, it has been decided that all Colleges and Universities will be permitted to conduct classes on rotational basis with effect from 1.9.2021 by following the Standard Operating Procedures for conducting classes throughout the state except in containment zones.
A detailed copy of the GO and SOPs is attached with this mail. 

The aspiring student community of IIT Madras promises to follow the following measures if a decision to reopen institute are made in the upcoming days :
We agree to abide by the rules and health measures and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) ordered by the government of Tamil Nadu.
We would like to mention that our Parents/ Guardians are willing to send us college at their own risk. 
If we are called back to campus, we are ready for the quarantine of 14 days and promise to attend classes on  online mode in that period so that we don’t lag with academic schedule.
As far as the slots are available, students would get vaccinated. The vaccination status of each student will also be attached through this mail via google form.
Wherever possible, students will reside in nearby relatives houses and attend classes so that overcrowding will be avoided in Hostels.
Cultural activities, meetings, etc., will be avoided from our side.
We ensure that wearing a mask/ face cover will be strictly followed at all the places all the time.
We will also participate in activities to stay fit, physically and mentally, by doing exercises like yoga, breathing, meditation, etc.
We would regularly sanitize our laptops, audio, video and other media accessories.
No discrimination based on caste, creed or gender will allowed to take place.

Since November 16, we have been attending online classes respecting the decisions taken by the government and IITM administration. But this is having a serious impact on the mental and physical health of students. Professors and the course coordinators are trying their best to make online-learning student friendly and we appreciate their efforts too. But it has become hard for a majority of the students to concentrate and focus consistently because of network issues and many other considerable reasons. 
It was and still is really unfortunate that we had to spend our entire first year without visiting campus. We couldn’t explore many things (almost everything that we dreamt of during our JEE preparation). Most importantly, we are not able to sense the pride of being a part of such a prestigious institution and are afraid that our curiosity to learn and explore things will vanish  by just hoping for things to change.
We are badly in need of the social exposure that would build our social etiquette. We wished to have personal interaction with professors to know what we are truly interested in and know our passion to excel in our future. With the online platform, we are not at all sure if we could apply the theoretical things that we learned in the practical world.
We don’t blame our institute for all this, but our patience levels are deteriorating enough to ask for a change.
 
As informed by the IITM administration department, we have been waiting for the TN government order to reopen our hostel and campus to the students. Now, we got what we had waited for. The new G.O. released has given us a hope to get back to campus. As of now, many other institutions like IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Hyderabad, BITS, etc., have been opened and concerned reports say that the student crowd is managed successfully. With our standards of NIRF ranking 1 and the enormous campus area that we have, it is quite easy to handle this situation.

In this regard, we kindly request the concerned authorities to grant permission for offline classes. We and our parents are eagerly waiting for the decision. 
Hoping for a positive response and a favorable conclusion on our exposure to real college life. 

Thanking You 
Yours Sincerely
CRs | 2020 batch

30/08/2021, 20:19 - Bhargav: See, if someone snitches on a guy, and the guy gets suspended or smtg...
Then others will make him his target...
The clg can't suspend a whole class ryt...
30/08/2021, 20:19 - Navin EE: Salute, nikkal kundhal, joy, flash all were just excuses to slap ppl.
30/08/2021, 20:19 - Ishaan Agarwal: Basically whenever you stand up or sit down, you are supposed to say "salute", otherwise the other person gives you a punch in the back.
30/08/2021, 20:20 - Purvam Jain: Ig there weren't many such students there people kept to themselves and their group and their stuff

02/09/2021, 11:50 - Bijo John: And this
02/09/2021, 11:51 - Kushagra Agrawal: I think till lect 14 laplace circuits hv not been introduced
02/09/2021, 11:51 - Bijo John: Bruh the solving part is easier than solving regular DE, the hard part is to get the ILT
02/09/2021, 11:51 - Bijo John: And they will never be, I think
02/09/2021, 11:51 - Ishaan Agarwal: Tut has some qns, so might come.

03/09/2021, 22:41 - Soham Roy: 8 bit register can point to 2^8 locations in memory (addresses)
these 16-bit storages point to any other 16 bit register

03/09/2021, 22:42 - Ashita Anil: <Media omitted>

03/09/2021, 22:42 - Ashita Anil: Asli toppers
03/09/2021, 22:42 - Soham Roy: thus effectively they can point to 2^16 locations, but the processor we are concerned with has only 2^9 locations, so 2^9-1 
-1 because doesn't make sense to point to itself
03/09/2021, 22:43 - Soham Roy: immediate is like a constant in programming
direct is a variable
indirect is a pointer that points to an actual variable
03/09/2021, 22:43 - Soham Roy: just came back now
03/09/2021, 22:43 - Jayanth B: This is effectively useless right?
03/09/2021, 22:44 - Jayanth B: Oh well maybe not
03/09/2021, 22:45 - Soham Roy: 2^9 part is not very relevant
03/09/2021, 22:45 - Soham Roy: but it's basically a pointer, enables us to do all sorts of kinky stuff
03/09/2021, 22:45 - Jayanth B: Yep got it 🥰🥰
03/09/2021, 22:46 - Nipun EE: Damn the worlds burning

07/09/2021, 22:29 - Manomukil T: Finding more pics of gawd
07/09/2021, 22:30 - Harisankar K J: You had literally anything to capture why this?😂😂
07/09/2021, 22:30 - Manomukil T: I didn't
07/09/2021, 22:30 - Manomukil T: It's a sticker I got from navin🙂
07/09/2021, 22:30 - Harisankar K J: Wah

07/09/2021, 22:36 - Ishaan Agarwal: I haven't reached this part yet, but isn't this just basic Lenz law? or were we taught new shit to deal with this?
07/09/2021, 22:36 - Nipun EE: lenz law only
07/09/2021, 22:36 - Nipun EE: but speed is c right, so
07/09/2021, 22:36 - Nipun EE: is there some unique rule like, heck it fails at high speeds??
07/09/2021, 22:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 22:37 - Nipun EE: my reaction exactly :(
07/09/2021, 22:39 - Ria Ann: is this 2025 what is this heck
07/09/2021, 22:40 - Soham Roy: transit time effect means i would not change uniformly, but I think we should neglect that to maintain sanity
07/09/2021, 22:41 - Nipun EE: aight
07/09/2021, 22:41 - Nipun EE: engineering tricks op
07/09/2021, 22:41 - Soham Roy: as in it would take some time for the emf to generate after B changes value
07/09/2021, 22:41 - Soham Roy: but I don't see how to account, considering B is not unidistant from i
07/09/2021, 22:41 - Nipun EE: exactly and when the course talks about transmission lines for that very purpose
07/09/2021, 22:42 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 22:42 - Soham Roy: but how did you reach tut 3 Q7 already
07/09/2021, 22:43 - Soham Roy: im enjoying tut 2 q2 solution
07/09/2021, 22:44 - Nipun EE: do a bit of everything 😎
07/09/2021, 22:47 - Ishaan Agarwal: but isn't B uniform across the square?
07/09/2021, 22:47 - Ishaan Agarwal: how does transit time come into picture here?
07/09/2021, 22:48 - Ishaan Agarwal: transit from where to where
07/09/2021, 22:48 - Soham Roy: Changing B is generating an E in the loop, right
07/09/2021, 22:49 - Soham Roy: So every point inside the loop is affecting every poont on the loop
07/09/2021, 22:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: Okay I still don't see how transit time comes into play.
07/09/2021, 22:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: Since the square is symmetrical with respect to the field, isn't it counter intuitive that each point differs in current at a give time.
07/09/2021, 22:52 - Nipun EE: My boy, you make the cardinal error of questioning
07/09/2021, 22:52 - Nipun EE: There's no time in IIT to think, just lap up the formulae and do the tuts
07/09/2021, 22:53 - Soham Roy: a point at a corner will take longer to be affected by the whole insides of the square than a point at the centre of an edge, why not
07/09/2021, 22:53 - Bijo John: Small freq + short length means it can be safely neglected ryt
07/09/2021, 22:53 - Nipun EE: How this small freq pa
07/09/2021, 22:53 - Nipun EE: Its light speed
07/09/2021, 22:54 - Bijo John: f=60 Hz 🙂
07/09/2021, 22:54 - Ishaan Agarwal: okay this way. I see
07/09/2021, 22:54 - Ishaan Agarwal: pretty weird tho
07/09/2021, 22:54 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 22:54 - Bijo John: Okay wait I missed b part
07/09/2021, 22:55 - Bijo John: Yeah agree with soham
07/09/2021, 22:55 - Ishaan Agarwal: nah ukw, just do lenz law and rest go brrr. get marks, ez. otherwise, this seems like brainfuckery
07/09/2021, 22:55 - Bijo John: ++
07/09/2021, 22:55 - Bijo John: Not possible to quantify any weird shit that might happen
07/09/2021, 22:56 - Nipun EE: See exactly
07/09/2021, 22:56 - Nipun EE: Thinking is a waste of time
07/09/2021, 22:56 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 22:56 - Ishaan Agarwal: integrate average distance of each point on the loop to each point inside the loop
07/09/2021, 22:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: then use that as a measure for transit time effect?
07/09/2021, 22:57 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 22:57 - Bijo John: 😳
07/09/2021, 22:57 - Nipun EE: Let's stick with Lenz law, shall we
07/09/2021, 22:57 - Bijo John: How tho
07/09/2021, 22:58 - Ishaan Agarwal: assuming each point contributes equally to the E generated i.e
07/09/2021, 22:58 - Ishaan Agarwal: then average distance might be a good measure ayt?
07/09/2021, 22:58 - Ishaan Agarwal: YES
07/09/2021, 22:58 - Bijo John: B varies with y na
07/09/2021, 22:58 - Ishaan Agarwal: integrate to find*
07/09/2021, 22:59 - Ishaan Agarwal: lenz law OP

08/09/2021, 11:57 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: One question, voltmeter reads magnitude of V or real part of V?
08/09/2021, 11:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: This reminds me: "Because at that time, you see, I thought that everything that rhymed was true. So I thought, y'know, if I worked with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox...."
08/09/2021, 11:58 - Bijo John: Depends on the type of voltmeter ig
08/09/2021, 11:58 - Bijo John: Coz ik there are separate ammeters for ac and dc
08/09/2021, 12:00 - Soham Roy: If we use dc one for ac, it will swing like pendulum
08/09/2021, 12:00 - Bijo John: Haan that shows instantaneous value of current
08/09/2021, 12:01 - Ashita Anil: Nice no

08/09/2021, 13:08 - Ishaan Agarwal: I have a doubt in gauss law....if you still remember 😅.
We generally say electric field in the flux equation is the Net electric field, not due to internal charges alone.......

But flux due to external charges is 0 and can be removed from our equation right? So it's just flux due to electric field of inner charges?

Juniors asking doubts. Help^
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Soham Roy: I think he's correct
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yeah same
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Nipun EE: lmao
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Nipun EE: _if we remember_
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Nipun EE: dude thats our fucking life now
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Ishaan Agarwal: But then we were told multiple times that "the field is the net field"
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why was that then
08/09/2021, 13:10 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yeah. Flux due to outer fields is zero
08/09/2021, 13:11 - Soham Roy: flux is defined as actual field passing through a surface, that's why I think
08/09/2021, 13:11 - Ishaan Agarwal: I think that's coz he asked me some chem doubts before and I said I don't remember.
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Nipun EE: ah makes sense :)
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Nipun EE: ey why
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: It is na.
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: For not E caused due to charges
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Kushagra Agrawal: Flux due to outside field is not 0 ig
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: ~not~
08/09/2021, 13:12 - Kushagra Agrawal: There might be some random field present
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Kushagra Agrawal: Like E0*x
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why not? Number of field lines entering = number of field lines leaving.
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Kushagra Agrawal: And it will have a net flux
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Soham Roy: field due to outside charges is zero, kinky fields might still generate flux
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: .
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yes
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Can't be possible without charges present inside the surface you choose.
08/09/2021, 13:13 - Kushagra Agrawal: Haa point
08/09/2021, 13:14 - Soham Roy: and hence flux = q/eps
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Raunak P: Br, ths fkin 2016, wtf, qz on fr, hw to stdy,
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Raunak P: I didn't understand anything that he did in the last 2 weeks
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Raunak P: F
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Harisankar K J: But Friday holiday?

08/09/2021, 13:15 - Harisankar K J: Holiday go brrrr.
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Raunak P: Im trying to ask him to get rid of it
08/09/2021, 13:15 - Soham Roy: Non-instructional: tests and submissions applicable
08/09/2021, 13:16 - Nipun EE: iit op
08/09/2021, 13:16 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Please
08/09/2021, 13:16 - Raunak P: Or atleast put in evening

08/09/2021, 13:16 - Raunak P: He will give you one Modak in your quiz
08/09/2021, 13:16 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>

08/09/2021, 13:26 - Bijo John: Yes
08/09/2021, 13:27 - Bijo John: Because we can use that to account for the influence of an external charge distribution at some part of the gaussian surface... I think it was used when we got some weirdly shaped straight wires or so
08/09/2021, 13:27 - Bijo John: Or was this for ampere's law
08/09/2021, 13:29 - Bijo John: Put at 9 am da, get the shit done with. Else put a wide time window
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Raunak P: Someguy told me to keep in evening cause
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Raunak P: Puja
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Raunak P: It's big festival
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Ashita Anil: Yeah not morning 🥲
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Ashita Anil: Also mani does what he wants right?
08/09/2021, 13:30 - Raunak P: Pretty much yeah
08/09/2021, 13:31 - Raunak P: Asking him for extension of deadline for that tut itseof was a pain
08/09/2021, 13:31 - Raunak P: Itself*
08/09/2021, 13:31 - Ashita Anil: But isnt Friday a central gov holiday

08/09/2021, 13:31 - Raunak P: OnlyPain
08/09/2021, 13:32 - Raunak P: Who tf designed this calender
08/09/2021, 13:32 - Ashita Anil: Maniprsnhdndns
08/09/2021, 13:32 - Raunak P: That guy probably doesn't have a life
08/09/2021, 13:33 - Soham Roy: then keep window
08/09/2021, 13:33 - Soham Roy: evening also there is pooja
08/09/2021, 13:34 - Raunak P: Evening also
08/09/2021, 13:34 - Raunak P: Bruhhhh
08/09/2021, 13:34 - Raunak P: Death only
08/09/2021, 13:34 - Raunak P: Keep at when it is then?
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Kushagra Agrawal: What's the syllabus?
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Raunak P: Or should I try for Monday?
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Raunak P: This has very very low chances
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Kushagra Agrawal: Assignment 2 only?
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Raunak P: I'll ask after this class
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Soham Roy: what exactly do you mean by evening
08/09/2021, 13:35 - Bijo John: Yeah this seems super unlikely
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Raunak P: Like after 3 pm
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ok
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Raunak P: Actually
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Raunak P: They want us to be in mert
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Raunak P: Meet*
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Raunak P: So they also need to be free
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Soham Roy: there's proctoring from this time?
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Kushagra Agrawal: Then i think monday is best option
08/09/2021, 13:36 - Soham Roy: ah that thing
08/09/2021, 13:37 - Nipun EE: so portion is week 3 and 4?
08/09/2021, 13:38 - Nipun EE: since it doesnt seem like test gonna get postponed 😳
08/09/2021, 13:38 - Raunak P: Not proctoring
08/09/2021, 13:38 - Raunak P: Just stay in meet
08/09/2021, 13:38 - Raunak P: And then they solve questions
08/09/2021, 13:39 - Nipun EE: same happened last time, right
08/09/2021, 14:57 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:05 - Soham Roy: voltage across Z0 when Z0 and Rg in series
08/09/2021, 15:07 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: At t=0, How did it become Z0?
08/09/2021, 15:07 - Bijo John: Basically the effective resistance across the input terminals of tx line is Z0
08/09/2021, 15:08 - Bijo John: That I was never sure of 🥲
08/09/2021, 15:08 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: What about finding ZL' like we did for V+ calc?
08/09/2021, 15:08 - Soham Roy: no
08/09/2021, 15:08 - Soham Roy: transit time
08/09/2021, 15:09 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: 😪
08/09/2021, 15:09 - Soham Roy: at T = 0 ZL will have no effect on circuit
08/09/2021, 15:09 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: At t=0, the circuit views Z0 alone?
08/09/2021, 15:09 - Bijo John: 😳
08/09/2021, 15:09 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Oh
08/09/2021, 15:10 - Soham Roy: Yeah hence bounce diagram and all
08/09/2021, 15:14 - Bijo John: Wait, how is it possible to set up current without knowledge of the complete circuit?
08/09/2021, 15:20 - Ishaan Agarwal: bounce diagram resources?
08/09/2021, 15:20 - Ishaan Agarwal: checked on discord, nothing.
08/09/2021, 15:28 - Bijo John: Moodle
08/09/2021, 15:30 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: https://youtu.be/AmWPm8DnE7E she taughg pretty well
08/09/2021, 15:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: the 25 page pdf?
08/09/2021, 15:38 - Soumyadeep Kar: RG
08/09/2021, 15:38 - Soumyadeep Kar: But love you
08/09/2021, 15:39 - Kushagra Agrawal: 💔❤️
08/09/2021, 15:45 - Ashita Anil: Yeeee🫂
08/09/2021, 15:49 - Bijo John: She didn't draw a bounce diagram 🥲
08/09/2021, 15:49 - Bijo John: Okay nvm
08/09/2021, 15:49 - Bijo John: Gotta watch 9-2
08/09/2021, 15:50 - Soham Roy: the voltage and thus current hasn't travelled to ZL at T = 0, so it is irrelevant, we only experience Characteristic impedence of the TX line, it seems
08/09/2021, 15:50 - Soham Roy: solved tut example might be enough
08/09/2021, 15:50 - Raunak P: Just gotta bounce bounce bounce bounce
08/09/2021, 15:51 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Yep watching 4 would do ig
08/09/2021, 15:54 - Bijo John: 🤔 afaik current flow cannot be set up if information of a complete circuit is not transmitted, for instance if an open circuit is closed current flow starts after an interval of l/v where l is circuit length and v is velocity of information transfer or something like that
08/09/2021, 15:54 - Bijo John: Also what exactly is characteristic impedance, how does that not depend on distance travelled🥲🥲
08/09/2021, 15:55 - Kushagra Agrawal: Bcoz its defined using the primary parameter of a Tx which is constant
08/09/2021, 15:55 - Bijo John: Means?
08/09/2021, 15:56 - Soham Roy: Yeah but transmission lines are kinky, even with open circuit they transmit stuff
08/09/2021, 15:56 - Ishaan Agarwal: Okay fuck transmission lines, I'm gonna focus on the other stuff. 🥲
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: Serious kinks
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Kushagra Agrawal: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: Haan ab hamein pata chal gaya ki tune notes banaye Hain. Bhej.
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Kushagra Agrawal: Haa banaya hai but abhi complete nahi hai
08/09/2021, 15:57 - Bijo John: Arey not that, how does it even make sense to consider Z0
08/09/2021, 15:58 - Kushagra Agrawal: Shaam tak bhejta hu
08/09/2021, 15:58 - Soham Roy: You're thinking of lumped element analysis
08/09/2021, 15:58 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: I have something that might help, sai shashank made it
08/09/2021, 15:58 - Kushagra Agrawal: Power transmission tak hua hai
08/09/2021, 15:58 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Harisankar K J: Thanks
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Harisankar K J: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Soham Roy: GG
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Bijo John: Yes, but I don't get how distributed analysis gonna help, how does voltage travel like that 🥲
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Bijo John: Okay fuck it all, learn formulae
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Kushagra Agrawal: God level
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Soham Roy: even though cloud to ground circuit isn't complete, voltage develops at some points and then distributes throughout the whole cloud system na
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Ishaan Agarwal: GG
08/09/2021, 15:59 - Soham Roy: In >0 time
08/09/2021, 16:00 - Bijo John: Cloud to ground circuit is complete na, just that the flow is negligible
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Kushagra Agrawal: I don't know what ur asking🥲
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Soham Roy: it's incomplete till lightning strikes, you can say
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Soham Roy: In any case voltage is developed due to charge na
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Soham Roy: If I connect a battery to two long wires, voltage will be developed at the end of the wires
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Bijo John: Haan yes
08/09/2021, 16:01 - Nipun EE: Cloud??
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Nipun EE: Now when did this come from 🥸
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Soham Roy: but only because charges actually travelled through them
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Bijo John: Yeah, makes sense
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Soham Roy: bad analogy, ignore
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Raunak P: Baadal ☁️☁️
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Ishaan Agarwal: Pe paon hain
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Soham Roy: so it seemingly turns out that initial current and voltage across transmission line depends on Z0 and Zg not ZL
08/09/2021, 16:02 - Soham Roy: which makes sense
08/09/2021, 16:03 - Bijo John: How does Z0 come in 🥲
08/09/2021, 16:03 - Soham Roy: Transmission line's material will affect the voltage and current transmitted through it
08/09/2021, 16:03 - Soham Roy: now why is it so neatly uniform, idk
08/09/2021, 16:03 - Nipun EE: wait u guys are discussing why t=0 impedance is Z0
08/09/2021, 16:03 - Nipun EE: right?
08/09/2021, 16:04 - Soham Roy: why initial voltage across TX line doesn't depend on ZL although it is in circuit, yes
08/09/2021, 16:04 - Bijo John: If I've gotten it right, V1 is the voltage at generator end, why would the wire affect it if voltage has not started to pass through it
08/09/2021, 16:04 - Ishaan Agarwal: Impedance varies with time uh? Excuse my illiteracy.
08/09/2021, 16:04 - Nipun EE: oh ok
08/09/2021, 16:05 - Kushagra Agrawal: Illiteracy excused
08/09/2021, 16:05 - Soham Roy: Because Zg is also there na adjacent to it
08/09/2021, 16:05 - Bijo John: Zg fine, but why Z0? Zg is a lumped resistor, what exactly is Z0 even 🥴
08/09/2021, 16:05 - Ishaan Agarwal: Answer toh bata de fir 🥲
08/09/2021, 16:07 - Soham Roy: not impedence but voltage across TX line (and also across Zg, indirectly)
08/09/2021, 16:27 - Kushagra Agrawal: Did anyone understand the impedance matching technique using stubs??
08/09/2021, 16:27 - Kushagra Agrawal: Pls explan🙏
08/09/2021, 16:28 - Nipun EE: arey do we have stubs
08/09/2021, 16:28 - Nipun EE: nothing given in tut 😳
08/09/2021, 16:28 - Soham Roy: It was explained using smitch charts right
08/09/2021, 16:28 - Kushagra Agrawal: Yes
08/09/2021, 16:29 - Kushagra Agrawal: Does that mean application of Tx is not in syllabus?
08/09/2021, 16:29 - Soham Roy: application of TX is in syllabus
08/09/2021, 16:30 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Only single stub there ig
08/09/2021, 16:33 - Kushagra Agrawal: So why is impedance matching not there in notes on moodle
08/09/2021, 16:34 - Nipun EE: wut
08/09/2021, 16:34 - Nipun EE: moodle has notes?
08/09/2021, 16:35 - Soham Roy: unknown impedence, equivalent reactance, resonant lines are there na
08/09/2021, 16:35 - Soham Roy: I assume you mean NPTEL notes
08/09/2021, 16:36 - Kushagra Agrawal: No.
I mean notes on moodle
08/09/2021, 16:36 - Kushagra Agrawal: Named transmission lines
08/09/2021, 16:36 - Kushagra Agrawal: And what the fuxk is digital transmission lines
08/09/2021, 16:37 - Soham Roy: haven't seen fully
08/09/2021, 18:54 - Jayanth B: What all is there under application of TX lines
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Kushagra Agrawal: I think measurement of ZL and as a circuit element only
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Kushagra Agrawal: And transformer too
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Kushagra Agrawal: Not sure abt impedance maching
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Jayanth B: Mmm okay
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Resonance too
08/09/2021, 18:55 - Jayanth B: 🤧
08/09/2021, 18:56 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Unakellam enna pa
08/09/2021, 18:56 - Jayanth B: Is this that lambda/4 thing
08/09/2021, 18:56 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yea, for open and short circuits
08/09/2021, 18:58 - Raunak P: We weren't taught that I think
08/09/2021, 18:58 - Raunak P: Bijoy batch
08/09/2021, 18:59 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Also, are the digital transmission things like Line with discountinuities, Impedance load there?🤧
08/09/2021, 19:00 - Jayanth B: Discontinuities?
08/09/2021, 19:00 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: 🤧🤧
08/09/2021, 19:04 - Kushagra Agrawal: What is digital transmission lines?
08/09/2021, 19:06 - Bijo John: Idts, too long and time consuming na
08/09/2021, 19:13 - Kushagra Agrawal: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Soham Roy: official solution is there
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Kushagra Agrawal: Where?
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Soham Roy: count squares horizontally and vertically
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Kushagra Agrawal: Gimme
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Soham Roy: moodle
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Soham Roy: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 19:21 - Kushagra Agrawal: Thenks
08/09/2021, 19:23 - Kushagra Agrawal: Lol I'm watching Anil sir's lect at 3x
Guy speaks so slowly
08/09/2021, 19:24 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: But why?
08/09/2021, 19:24 - Ashita Anil: Its fun?
08/09/2021, 19:24 - Kushagra Agrawal: For digital transmission lines

08/09/2021, 20:07 - Nipun EE: You are true tompr
08/09/2021, 20:09 - Nipun EE: Also guys do any of you mine bitcoin 😳
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Raunak P: none of us have that kinda setup
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Raunak P: pc set up
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Harisankar K J: 3080 is kinda minimum right?
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Manomukil T: U need good hardware bro
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Nipun EE: Makes sense
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Manomukil T: And time
08/09/2021, 20:10 - Shrey Shah: And with what we have, it is pretty meaningless to do it
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Nipun EE: But if you do, does it make sense to mine it?
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Nipun EE: Can you convert bitcoin to Normal money lmao?
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Shrey Shah: Yes obv
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Harisankar K J: depends
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Nipun EE: Ooh
08/09/2021, 20:11 - Shrey Shah: Idk about how to do it in the case of mined btc like which wallet it goes but there's always a way
08/09/2021, 20:12 - Shrey Shah: In case u wanna do it join a mining pool, don't believe in lotteries
08/09/2021, 20:13 - Nipun EE: hmm
08/09/2021, 20:13 - Nipun EE: so people who do this professional, just run their computers all day?
08/09/2021, 20:13 - Nipun EE: *professionally
08/09/2021, 20:13 - Shrey Shah: Check out a few photos of mining pools in china
08/09/2021, 20:14 - Harisankar K J: It,s banned there right?
08/09/2021, 20:14 - Nipun EE: woahh
08/09/2021, 20:14 - Shrey Shah: It's like crazy af computation power required making big warehouse sized structure into ovens due to the excess computation from the many advanced CPUs, partly the reason why people believe we need to think greener
08/09/2021, 20:14 - Shrey Shah: Yes, but they had the largest mining pools and guess the reason?
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Raunak P: hence gpus, but then
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Raunak P: gaming takes lesser force out of the gpu
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Nipun EE: 🥴
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Harisankar K J: but doesn't its mining can lead to its inflation right?
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Shrey Shah: Due to subsidised electricity, china electricity very cheap and mining takes a shit load of electricity for those computers, due to this reason more than 40% of world's mining done in China b4 the ban
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Harisankar K J: hmmm...
08/09/2021, 20:15 - Nipun EE: DL and crypto gonna snatch the gpus from the gamers
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Harisankar K J: Its already happening
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Shrey Shah: Do u know the rate of btc generation due to mining?
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Nipun EE: does it follow that kind of economics?
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Raunak P: its like 0.00001 or smth
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Harisankar K J: nope
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Harisankar K J: yup
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 20:16 - Shrey Shah: It started with 50BTC, then 25 BTC, now it is 12.5 and it is already pre written how much it will be at what point in time
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: theres a fixed rate that everyone can mine,
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: i think its 6 btc
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: /hr
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Harisankar K J: ohh
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Shrey Shah: This ensures no. of BTC to ever exist = 21 Million, thus no inflation
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: /day*
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: so if 12 million ppl mine
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: you can to the math
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Nipun EE: i mean, the guy who has access to the code can just change it, right?
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: how much one will get
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Shrey Shah: No one has
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Harisankar K J: thst depends on the ower of the device tho
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: its not that simple
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Raunak P: no no
08/09/2021, 20:17 - Shrey Shah: that's not how it works
08/09/2021, 20:18 - Nipun EE: ah
08/09/2021, 20:18 - Harisankar K J: power*
08/09/2021, 20:18 - Shrey Shah: The beauty of every crypto is decentralised
08/09/2021, 20:19 - Shrey Shah: Theres gonna be 12.5 BTC or no BTC every 10 minutes
08/09/2021, 20:19 - Shrey Shah: For every miner in the world
08/09/2021, 20:20 - Shrey Shah: And don't get excited the probably of u winning is like 10^-18ish with the computers u have
08/09/2021, 20:21 - Nipun EE: oh wait so every 10 min everyone in the world tries to 'solve' the puzzle, and the guy who does it first gets 12.5 BTC
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Rushill Bairavan: Idts
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Raunak P: my bad
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Raunak P: ill shut
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Shrey Shah: There's no first second, it is only one guy is able to do it usually in the whole world in those 10 minutes
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Nipun EE: oh damn
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
08/09/2021, 20:22 - Nipun EE: so if no one solves it

12/09/2021, 00:20 - Bijo John: Well it isn't broken actually, I'm just trying to move my ubuntu to ssd 😬
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ooh, Bun too
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Manomukil T: Y didn't u do that while partioning in the beginning?
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Bijo John: I'd surely like a quick fix 🥰
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Bijo John: Stupid move on my part
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Bijo John: And some misinformation
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Manomukil T: Lemme tell u my opinion
12/09/2021, 00:21 - Manomukil T: I don't think laptop hardware settings will let u move it that easily
12/09/2021, 00:22 - Manomukil T: Worst case is to uninstall Ubuntu and then reinstall it
12/09/2021, 00:22 - Manomukil T: Properly
12/09/2021, 00:22 - Manomukil T: But this is risky as it might screw up.ur booting and all if not done properly
12/09/2021, 00:22 - Bijo John: I don't wanna install all that software again 🥲
12/09/2021, 00:22 - Manomukil T: Conclusion: contact other gawds
12/09/2021, 00:23 - Bijo John: Seems like the easiest option tbh 😬
12/09/2021, 00:23 - Manomukil T: I have been tempted by this and implemented it
12/09/2021, 00:23 - Manomukil T: Twice
12/09/2021, 00:23 - Manomukil T: Booting got screwed both times
12/09/2021, 00:23 - Bijo John: 😳 what happened
12/09/2021, 00:24 - Manomukil T: Basically while removing the grub loader my boot partition gets corrupted
12/09/2021, 00:24 - Manomukil T: I have to change boot settings from BIOS to legacy as a temporary fix
12/09/2021, 00:25 - Manomukil T: But since I heard BIOS is more secure solution is to rewrite entire boot partition

15/09/2021, 08:56 - Nipun EE: Bruhhhh😂😂😂
15/09/2021, 09:18 - Jayanth B: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 09:18 - Jayanth B: What's the point of that thing in bold
15/09/2021, 09:18 - Nipun EE: Mazidi went high
15/09/2021, 09:19 - Jayanth B: 😳😳
15/09/2021, 09:21 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Making portA.x active makes pinx high it seems. Even if pins aren't connected it reads as high. When you connect pins it will get adjusted between high and low so it's fine. This is done to avoid the pins to go into some state where the signal read becomes unreliable
15/09/2021, 09:21 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: That's what I understood
15/09/2021, 09:27 - Jayanth B: PortA.x is the bit in the register?
15/09/2021, 09:28 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yea one of the three registers
15/09/2021, 09:39 - Jayanth B: Connect pins meaning? When you give an input?
15/09/2021, 09:41 - Navin EE: Even I dint understand this so went to stackexchange. The ans there quotes mazidi again
15/09/2021, 09:41 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yea
15/09/2021, 09:41 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 09:41 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Harish sent one link na
15/09/2021, 09:41 - Nipun EE: Only the madlad mazidi can explain himself
15/09/2021, 09:43 - Jayanth B: I don't get what difference does making PORTC pull up active make in comparison to the first example
15/09/2021, 09:43 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: It makes the output stable
15/09/2021, 09:43 - Jayanth B: Which output?
15/09/2021, 09:44 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Cha input
15/09/2021, 09:45 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 09:45 - Jayanth B: Without DDRx register holding some value there will be no input itself right
15/09/2021, 09:45 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: That should be 0x00 for input mode
15/09/2021, 09:45 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: By default it is ig
15/09/2021, 09:46 - Jayanth B: Ohh okay
15/09/2021, 10:16 - Soham Roy: deep learning?
15/09/2021, 10:17 - Soham Roy: when no input, default becomes 11111111 if we did pullup, otherwise unefined value on no input
15/09/2021, 10:18 - Navin EE: Okay but y does this happen for high impedance connections also?
15/09/2021, 10:19 - Soham Roy: Dor bigh impedance there is no default na
15/09/2021, 10:20 - Soumyadeep Kar: Yes
15/09/2021, 10:20 - Jayanth B: Is he making spelling mistakes or do I not know these short forms
15/09/2021, 10:22 - Soham Roy: I just wole from nap
15/09/2021, 10:22 - Navin EE: Book says if nothing is connected to pin or if high impedance connected to pin and pull-up resistor is active then it becomes 11111111
15/09/2021, 10:22 - Soham Roy: By impedance I mean thwpin itself not external
15/09/2021, 10:23 - Jayanth B: Ok soham wake up fully and then reply
15/09/2021, 10:23 - Ishaan Agarwal: I think he means Drivers license 😂
15/09/2021, 10:23 - Soham Roy: Pin can either be high impedancw or pull up, pullup would mean default is 1s
15/09/2021, 10:24 - Navin EE: Hmm okay fine
15/09/2021, 10:46 - Purvam Jain: Drivers license

22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: Doesn't make sense no 😂
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: To set it write 1
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Ishaan Agarwal: none at all
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: And then to clear
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: You have to write 1
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: What is ishaans rank?
22/09/2021, 09:40 - Raunak P: 1
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: @917550077183 WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Raunak P: Lmao
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Bijo John: Nope, we don't manually set the TOV flags
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: but but
22/09/2021, 09:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: but
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: they said so, didn't they
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: oh
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: wait
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: so we don't manually set
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Bijo John: Yeah it's weird af 😞
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: but only manually clear
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Bijo John: They said what?
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Bijo John: Yep
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: and that's why only 1 works
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: weird asf, but okay
22/09/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: so basically me giving 1 makes it take 0?
22/09/2021, 09:43 - Bijo John: Yeah... maybe the flags have some sort of pullup resistance involved 🤔
22/09/2021, 09:43 - Raunak P: Oh shit yeah
22/09/2021, 09:43 - Raunak P: But still confusion
22/09/2021, 09:44 - Ishaan Agarwal: confusion hee confusion hai

22/09/2021, 10:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Or does set mean 0, coz reset mean 1?
22/09/2021, 10:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: 🤡
22/09/2021, 10:15 - Soham Roy: I think TOV0 in "1<<TOV0" could be a constant the denotes the bit position of TOV0 so that you can access it without having to remember the position
22/09/2021, 10:15 - Soham Roy: constant bein 0, here
22/09/2021, 10:22 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ahh makes sense. 🙏🏻
22/09/2021, 10:23 - Ishaan Agarwal: Probably in the header.
22/09/2021, 10:28 - Bijo John: Yes
22/09/2021, 10:28 - Bijo John: The header defines a lot of constants like that
22/09/2021, 10:36 - Manomukil T: Do we have to make flowchart b4 the lab session?

22/09/2021, 10:40 - Jayanth B: All 4 tasks are just fill ups uh?
22/09/2021, 10:40 - Nipun EE: Only 2 right

22/09/2021, 10:41 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Same da, again for INT0
22/09/2021, 10:41 - Jayanth B: Okay
22/09/2021, 10:41 - Jayanth B: So the only concern now is Lab quiz?

23/09/2021, 16:50 - Harisankar K J: *sent
23/09/2021, 16:56 - Ashita Anil: Shd get up early for this🥲
23/09/2021, 19:04 - Ashita Anil: Sir, I actually don't know any formal definition of an "n-ly" connected set. I can say that if a set has "n holes" then it is "n-ly" connected. So, here I can see two holes merging to one hole with two holes having a common point (as the middle point of the figure 8 doesn't belong to D due to open-ness of D, so it belongs to the hole/holes). But, now should I consider that figure 8 to be one hole or two holes ?
23/09/2021, 19:04 - Ashita Anil: Math doubt of the year
23/09/2021, 19:05 - Soham Roy: Hurt
23/09/2021, 19:06 - Soham Roy: Oh okay, does 8 have one hole or two

24/09/2021, 22:33 - Soham Roy: 7.5 for 6 = 1.25 per tut
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Manomukil T: But it didn't happen like that na🥲
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Manomukil T: And that 1.25 marks how does he evaluate?
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Soham Roy: approximately it did
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Soham Roy: if you solve half the tut you get approx 0.625
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Purvam Jain: u didn't know every question amounts to 2.5? if 10 questions for 25 marks
24/09/2021, 22:34 - Abhiram: My TA graded the first tut out of 21.5 and told it’ll be scaled down later on

08/10/2021, 19:33 - Shivanshu Shekhar: you too =)
08/10/2021, 19:33 - Purvam Jain: I am not saying purifying is bad for health but there is no control over how much chemicals are being used or if process is being done in a correct way
08/10/2021, 19:33 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Chennai's most of the water supply is from reservoirs right

09/10/2021, 19:33 - Rushill Bairavan: Man gave up
09/10/2021, 19:49 - Ishaan Agarwal: Cringe max.
09/10/2021, 19:50 - Harisankar K J: Idk if it should be called 'cringe'
09/10/2021, 19:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: Other than studies, what are your hobbies? 
Our man: Nothing
Audience: Claps
Me: Hangs.
09/10/2021, 19:50 - Harisankar K J: <Media omitted>
09/10/2021, 19:51 - Soham Roy: it's sad
09/10/2021, 19:51 - Soham Roy: reflection of an outdated underfunded system
09/10/2021, 19:52 - Raunak P: If only I could be like him 😖😖
09/10/2021, 19:53 - Raunak P: <Media omitted>
09/10/2021, 19:53 - Rushill Bairavan: As long as being like this will improve your ranks, there will be people like this😪
09/10/2021, 19:54 - Ishaan Agarwal: Tbh it's the coaching teachers which fill in this mentality.
09/10/2021, 19:55 - Ishaan Agarwal: IIT is everything. And shit like that.
09/10/2021, 19:55 - Soham Roy: nah, just look at his father as well
09/10/2021, 19:55 - Soham Roy: iit cs then foreign management = ez money
09/10/2021, 19:55 - Ishaan Agarwal: Time to send this to elec group, and watch Rama's reaction. Ex
09/10/2021, 19:55 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ez*
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Raunak P: He won't get in tbh
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Soham Roy: why not
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Raunak P: They require a diverse profile
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Ishaan Agarwal: He has no hobbies 😭
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Raunak P: Or so I think
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Ishaan Agarwal: Bro imagine this guy being interviewed.
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Soham Roy: for management the main requirement is money
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Raunak P: And tbh he doesn't have any general knowledge either
09/10/2021, 19:56 - Raunak P: M tech or mba
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Raunak P: "Idk the difference"
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Rushill Bairavan: Idk, feels like he'll be able to catch up quickly in all that
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Raunak P: True, but still
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Jayanth B: Gay
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Raunak P: Anyway leave it's probably my insecurities screaming out now
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Soham Roy: it isn't that tough to get into, not like he's only going for ivy league
09/10/2021, 19:57 - Rushill Bairavan: Will probably only be stunted in hobbies and such
09/10/2021, 19:58 - Raunak P: I mean I think he's talking wet ivy league
09/10/2021, 19:58 - Ishaan Agarwal: But I really doubt if there are many people like him, most people I meet in IIT have some sort of personality traits other than "I studied day-night and made it to IIT".
09/10/2021, 19:58 - Raunak P: There are many who don't also I think
09/10/2021, 19:58 - Raunak P: Probably some of the ones who haven't interacted with ppl or smth
09/10/2021, 19:58 - Raunak P: Not sure
09/10/2021, 19:59 - Raunak P: Like out of 155 in elec about 30 ppl or smth interact ig
09/10/2021, 19:59 - Raunak P: Slightly more
09/10/2021, 20:00 - Soham Roy: In that case I agree with you, not getting in
09/10/2021, 20:00 - Soham Roy: Exactly, probably lots of purely studious guys
09/10/2021, 20:00 - Raunak P: After all it is iit
09/10/2021, 20:01 - Raunak P: And we know the kinda shit it takes to get in here
09/10/2021, 20:01 - Ishaan Agarwal: It baffles me that so many people are just there in the group with a total of <5 messages over the whole year.
09/10/2021, 20:01 - Raunak P: Do you think it's his parents fault tho?
09/10/2021, 20:01 - Raunak P: Ah yes, 2 of them are thank you on bday
09/10/2021, 20:01 - Harisankar K J: 💯
09/10/2021, 20:02 - Ishaan Agarwal: Imagine meeting them IRL and they know a lot of stuff about you coz they been reading the chats. But you know nothing about them.
09/10/2021, 20:02 - Harisankar K J: Kinda
09/10/2021, 20:02 - Raunak P: That'd be fun xD
09/10/2021, 20:02 - Ishaan Agarwal: More like creepy for me 😂
09/10/2021, 20:03 - Raunak P: Lmaoo
09/10/2021, 20:03 - Raunak P: They probably won't speak up tbh
09/10/2021, 20:03 - Raunak P: That they know you
09/10/2021, 20:03 - Ishaan Agarwal: That's even more creepy now that I think about it 😂
09/10/2021, 20:04 - Harisankar K J: Some parents say "do this...do that.." to their kid at an early age making an inscription in the kids mind as he grows up
09/10/2021, 20:04 - Ashita Anil: I have 0 respect for such parents more than kids
09/10/2021, 20:04 - Raunak P: Bro 😂😂
09/10/2021, 20:04 - Navin EE: ++, completely their fault imo
09/10/2021, 20:04 - Navin EE: Or is it coz of parents of the parents 🤔
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ashita Anil: Unless his dad is next to him, he'll just laugh
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Raunak P: Not this tbh
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ashita Anil: Here he was a puppet pa
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ashita Anil: Just study, mug and ace exams
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Raunak P: Well one good thing about this is that hes smiling all the time
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Rushill Bairavan: Entirely
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ashita Anil: Then his dad was teaching him what to do
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ishaan Agarwal: Bruh there's this kid in my flats.
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Ishaan Agarwal: He's in 6th I think.
09/10/2021, 20:05 - Navin EE: Despite that he seemed genuinely happy tho🤷
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Rushill Bairavan: Ikr, didn't go into depression or something
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Raunak P: He doesn't know what to feel 😂
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Ashita Anil: ++++
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Ishaan Agarwal: His mom makes him talk to me almost every alternate day to motivate him to start preparing for JEE. I'm like wtf
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Harisankar K J: I don't think it's the parents fault completely.. as they want the best for their children but lack of proper knowledge about the stuff makes them think it's better not to take a risk and have a more secure life 🙃
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Harisankar K J: Tru
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Ashita Anil: 
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Navin EE: His dad told him what he was feeling is called happiness.
09/10/2021, 20:06 - Harisankar K J: Atleast in camera
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Ashita Anil: 😂😂😂
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Raunak P: Be like, "aunty, aap to iit prep ke liye late ho gaye. Aapko iski birth hone se pehle shuru karna tha"
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Harisankar K J: 😂😂
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Rushill Bairavan: F
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ahh yes.
09/10/2021, 20:07 - Ashita Anil: But completely making ur kid a robot is very wrong
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Ashita Anil: Ughhh
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Actually we weren't motivated that way. School teacher reminded us what was important. I actually miss them 😭
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Ishaan Agarwal: Bro, iit is good only. Not denying it. We're just saying that inscribing in the kids mind that iit is everything, and him having no life outside of it is wrong.
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Harisankar K J: They think it's better if they have most control
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Harisankar K J: Yes agreed
09/10/2021, 20:08 - Soham Roy: they probably only have material happiness in mind for him
09/10/2021, 20:09 - Harisankar K J: THINK
09/10/2021, 20:09 - Ashita Anil: Sad pa
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Harisankar K J: <Media omitted>
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Nice. Here I am helping my cousin prep for Bigbang🥲
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Rushill Bairavan: I don't think they think that🤔
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Rushill Bairavan: Tell him to use protection
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Rushill Bairavan: And don't be a pedo
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Raunak P: Poor choice of words
09/10/2021, 20:10 - Ashita Anil: 😂😂😂😂
09/10/2021, 20:11 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Big Bang Edge Test 🥲😭

09/10/2021, 20:15 - Raunak P: He was like okay so school ends at 3. Say you reach home by 4. So freshen up and eat snacks for 20 mins and from about 4 30 onwards, start studying for school until 7 30. And then from 7 45 start studying fiitjee material till 11 30 including dinner in between l. Then sleep.
09/10/2021, 20:15 - +91 98698 54321: He was like the guy in the video, studying all the time. He used to intentionally pour water on his benches so that no one sits with him and makes small talk. When we had pt period he would go and tell the pt sir secretly not to give games so that he could sit in class and study
09/10/2021, 20:15 - Raunak P: Now I need name

26/10/2021, 12:51 - Shivanshu Shekhar: They are the "True" gprs
26/10/2021, 12:51 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Others are used by sime special modes and stuff

26/10/2021, 12:57 - Kushagra Agrawal: Thanks!
26/10/2021, 12:58 - Bijo John: R0 to R7 are common GPRS for all modes, from R8-R12 there's a common one, and then a separate one for the 'fiq' mode. That makes 18 regs. R13 is stack pointer, R14 is link reg. The 'usr' and 'sys' modes share a common stack, while the other modes each have a separate stack, meaning there are total 6 copies of R13 and R14. That makes 30 regs. Then PC (R15) is common for all, making 31 regs
26/10/2021, 12:59 - Bijo John: Remaining 6 regs are status regs for all 7 modes, with usr and sys sharing one again
26/10/2021, 12:59 - Kushagra Agrawal: Ohhhh right...Thanks!

28/10/2021, 09:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Man, Nagendra sir is super smart tf
28/10/2021, 09:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: I've not met such profs before
28/10/2021, 09:13 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: All he needs is your address for that
28/10/2021, 09:14 - Ishaan Agarwal: ;)
28/10/2021, 09:19 - Jayanth B: 2015 dude only no
28/10/2021, 09:19 - Jayanth B: Ikr
28/10/2021, 09:19 - Jayanth B: He's a genius
28/10/2021, 09:20 - Ishaan Agarwal: yes yes
28/10/2021, 09:21 - Ishaan Agarwal: he did his UG in ee, iitm.
28/10/2021, 09:22 - Bijo John: More like he's been doing the same thing for years so there's no trick that he hasn't seen
28/10/2021, 09:27 - Bhargav: - _HSR_
28/10/2021, 09:29 - Snehitha Andapally: Lol
28/10/2021, 09:29 - Ishaan Agarwal: Nah mate, respect where respect is due.
28/10/2021, 09:29 - Jayanth B: Bruh
28/10/2021, 09:29 - Bijo John: Same reason why coaching profs appear to be way smarter than you when we start out, but by the end, not so much
28/10/2021, 09:29 - Jayanth B: My coaching profs were always smarter
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Yes 😂
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Bijo John: They aren't, just that they have way more experience
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Jayanth B: MSI🙇‍♂️
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: No
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Rushill Bairavan: Depends on centre
28/10/2021, 09:30 - Ishaan Agarwal: I'm not talking about the things we don't know, I'm just talking about the things we know. Like, say complex numbers. He seems to be much sharper than me, even though I thought I was pretty good at complex. Or maybe I'm just rusty.
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Ishaan Agarwal: ++
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Bijo John: You aren't good prolly
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Jayanth B: 😂😂😂😂
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Ishaan Agarwal: My maths sir was dumb asf.
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Ishaan Agarwal: 🙏🏻
28/10/2021, 09:31 - Bijo John: He's been doing it since years, ofc he's gonna be great
28/10/2021, 09:32 - Bijo John: Like see, how much experience do we have with complex numbers? Two years? That too while we were practicing a lot of other stuff. While profs grind at a topic for years on end
28/10/2021, 09:32 - Jayanth B: I don't think profs grind
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Bijo John: They grow from what they learn themselves, as well as what previous students show them
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Bijo John: Grind as in prepare
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Ishaan Agarwal: For a person that always had mediocre teachers, it just feels weird having a teacher super smarter than you.
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Ishaan Agarwal: Tu karna chahti grind -
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Bijo John: That yes, felt this when I joined coaching first
28/10/2021, 09:33 - Rushill Bairavan: ++ true
28/10/2021, 09:34 - Bijo John: Eventually got used to it, and at the end I see they aren't that much better than me
28/10/2021, 09:34 - Jayanth B: ...
28/10/2021, 09:34 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: And tbh I feel my factory teachers are way better than some of profs here
28/10/2021, 09:34 - Rushill Bairavan: Fiitjee chennai 🙏
28/10/2021, 09:34 - Rushill Bairavan: At teaching, def
28/10/2021, 09:35 - Ishaan Agarwal: Zero humility, hundred chadness. 🛐🙏🏻 Bijo OP.
28/10/2021, 09:35 - Rushill Bairavan: You flat out called your teachers mediocre bruh
28/10/2021, 09:35 - Bijo John: Exactly 😂
28/10/2021, 09:36 - Ishaan Agarwal: Coz they were? 🤡
28/10/2021, 09:36 - Bijo John: Both of us know you're way smarter than me
28/10/2021, 09:36 - Ishaan Agarwal: They literally hired graduates from some random xyz college with zero experience in jee.
28/10/2021, 09:36 - Bijo John: Same applies here, just at a different level
28/10/2021, 09:36 - Ishaan Agarwal: Our maths sir struggled with the most basic things.
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Bijo John: My coaching did the same, but the profs worked out stuff themselves and eventually became legend-level
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Bijo John: Like it takes time
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Rushill Bairavan: Oof, I had decent teachers then
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Bijo John: 4-5 years teaching same stuff, and practicing qns students pose
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: See, now you're just being sarcastic :(
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: ++
28/10/2021, 09:37 - Bijo John: And they become pros
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Ishaan Agarwal: The only good teacher I had was Chemistry sir.
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Bijo John: Nope, you score way better even though you spend less time
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Rushill Bairavan: How good were your profs at Olympiad level problems
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Bijo John: Unless you were RGing all along 😳
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Nice Q
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😏
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Bijo John: Better than I could ever be
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😂😂😂😂I wish I could answer this.
28/10/2021, 09:38 - Rushill Bairavan: Most of the learning happens in the first few hours, and I think you make a lot more careless mistakes
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: My math prof directly said "no olympiad problems have to be discussed" meanwhile phy sir used to do them for fun.
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Ishaan Agarwal: My Aakash math and phy profs never went past JEE main level  🛐
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Bijo John: + to both parts, but that's exactly why I say ishu is way smarter
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Bijo John: The first few hours, he learns way more than I do
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Rushill Bairavan: Nice
28/10/2021, 09:39 - Ishaan Agarwal: RG 😣😣😣😣😣😣😣
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Ishaan Agarwal: Sasuke the smartest mf tho.
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Rushill Bairavan: Try reading like him for a course and then decide
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Bijo John: I can't physically take that much binge at a stretch
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: why is today feeling like a holiday
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Bijo John: I need time
28/10/2021, 09:40 - Bijo John: And 2x is absolutely forbidden
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: 😦
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Abhiram: Our Phy sir is the best teacher I’ve had so far
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: You can once you do that for one course🐸
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Bijo John: Can't man, I tried
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Too good.
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: I've stopped binging, I have adopted @919004077855's methods 🛐🙏🏻
28/10/2021, 09:41 - Bijo John: I tried 1.5x for shev, eventually saw that I learned nothing, went back and saw at 1x
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Rushill Bairavan: Which are?
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Bijo John: Reading lec notes and solving tuts?
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Jayanth B: Lol
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: Skipping everything and going to the tutorial 😂
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Soham Roy: 🗄️
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: Mug formulas on the way.
28/10/2021, 09:42 - Rushill Bairavan: Watching at 1x gives you time to think in between and connect to previous things etc
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Ishaan Agarwal: ++ this, yes.
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Bijo John: Exactly
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Bijo John: 1.5 requires absolute focus and processing speed
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Ishaan Agarwal: But I've stopped caring about connecting lmao.
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Bijo John: And it fries my brain
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Jayanth B: I usually just wtach at 1.5 and take few pauses here and there
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Rushill Bairavan: Kaushik watches at 1x right?
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Jayanth B: I guess so
28/10/2021, 09:43 - Ishaan Agarwal: Deep fried brain curry. 😋
28/10/2021, 09:44 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Same but I write stuff to make sure I follow
28/10/2021, 09:44 - Jayanth B: Yeah me too
28/10/2021, 09:44 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Nice
28/10/2021, 09:44 - Bijo John: Only course I can speed up on in 2015, in 2015 I mostly lose coz of careless mistakes only 😞
28/10/2021, 09:45 - Bijo John: Theory is just slight upgrade from jee, so pretty ez to follow
28/10/2021, 09:45 - Ishaan Agarwal: This message was deleted
28/10/2021, 09:45 - Bijo John: This message was deleted
28/10/2021, 09:45 - Jayanth B: Careless mistakes is just so frustrating
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Soham Roy: what is the log plot people keep talking about
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Soham Roy: bode plot?
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Jayanth B: Yeah
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Soham Roy: is bode plot the only new thing
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Bijo John: Pain 🥲
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Jayanth B: It's not exactly new
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Bijo John: Depends on your familiarity with phasors
28/10/2021, 09:46 - Jayanth B: But you know
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Rushill Bairavan: Is that present in hayt?
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Jayanth B: Not sure haven't checked
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Am I the only one hearing this for the first time
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Rushill Bairavan: It's there in that tut
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Bijo John: Tut 2nd last qn?
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Ishaan Agarwal: H(jw) vs W
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Ishaan Agarwal: On a log log scale.
28/10/2021, 09:47 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Ah solving that now
28/10/2021, 09:49 - Soham Roy: They are an acquaintance
28/10/2021, 09:49 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 09:50 - Bijo John: I've come about to like doing phasors without actually drawing them
28/10/2021, 09:50 - Bijo John: 😞
28/10/2021, 09:53 - Ishaan Agarwal: Moment of magic: When you realise you can cover most possible signals by just doing e^st coz of Fourier transform.
28/10/2021, 09:53 - Ishaan Agarwal: 🛐
28/10/2021, 09:53 - Rushill Bairavan: 2 months too late 🙏
28/10/2021, 09:53 - Bijo John: Which is exactly why we focus on sinusoids
28/10/2021, 09:54 - Ishaan Agarwal: Sir i-

28/10/2021, 09:54 - Ishaan Agarwal: Let a man enjoy enlightenment.
28/10/2021, 09:55 - Jayanth B: 😳
28/10/2021, 09:58 - Soham Roy: gone are the days when simple taylor series were fun

28/10/2021, 10:06 - Soham Roy: b r u h
28/10/2021, 10:06 - Soham Roy: we did a lot of it for MA
28/10/2021, 10:07 - Bijo John: One again reaffirming that we tend to forget stuff we aren't constantly using
28/10/2021, 10:07 - Bijo John: *I
28/10/2021, 10:11 - Ishaan Agarwal: do we have a tut solution video (HSR)

09/11/2021, 11:27 - Bijo John: Umm almost every job gets boring and repetitive at one point I suppose, just that coding has zero physical involvement and so maybe it settles in faster :(
09/11/2021, 11:27 - Bijo John: Elec not boring 😤

09/11/2021, 11:28 - Ishaan Agarwal: Would you rather build and debug one function on a random app than work on a V10 engine of a supercar?

09/11/2021, 11:29 - Ishaan Agarwal: Don't get too excited until an official confirmation. We(2019 batch) have had a lot of moments of such hopeful events and at the end had to listen to only this thing: "Am I audible? Let me share my screen! Is the screen visible to you all?"🥲
09/11/2021, 11:29 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>

09/11/2021, 11:30 - Ishaan Agarwal: Eyy not really I guess both have their own perks.

I had a doubt

For stepper motor Q 
The order in which we set the pins is different in theory and the way sir did.
Why so?
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Bijo John: How did the theory set it
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Bijo John: Or do you just mean the reversal?
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Jayanth B: Pins 6,7,8,9 na
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Bijo John: That yes
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: The order is weird. I went and checked some websites and the values were very different
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Bijo John: 🤷‍♂️ who did it even
09/11/2021, 18:17 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: From what we are using

09/11/2021, 18:18 - Bijo John: ViARM development kit
09/11/2021, 18:19 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: That is just extension na 😂
09/11/2021, 18:19 - Bijo John: Nah, prolly each device may be using a different set of pins
09/11/2021, 18:19 - Bijo John: Each kit*
09/11/2021, 18:20 - Harisankar K J: There are actually only two(proper) orders afaik. One for clockwise and other for anticlockwise. If we activate the transistors randomly it'll not make any useful motion
09/11/2021, 18:22 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Totally 8 possible inputs. We are using some random 4 😂
09/11/2021, 18:22 - Harisankar K J: Put here once you understood it 😂😂
09/11/2021, 19:55 - Bijo John: Nope, there's a set pattern

09/11/2021, 19:56 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: See according to the website using the 8 we could turn to any 45 deg position
09/11/2021, 19:56 - Bijo John: Yeah, that's exactly what's being done here
09/11/2021, 19:56 - Bijo John: These give all 45 deg points
09/11/2021, 19:59 - Raunak P: Each step is a rotation of 2 degrees right?
09/11/2021, 20:00 - Bijo John: Yes
09/11/2021, 20:01 - Bijo John: Well, assuming the motor has a step angle of 2 degree
09/11/2021, 20:04 - Nipun EE: the lab endsem will only be qns like this, right

12/11/2021, 23:05 - Shrey Shah: Like i was thinking of applying but like abhigyan, my SMC mentor said 4th sem elec is not the best time to add any work load
12/11/2021, 23:06 - Shrey Shah: And like other than satisfaction of helping few juniors whom you can help otherwise as well what else you gaining from this

12/11/2021, 23:13 - Bijo John: Most non-tech pors
12/11/2021, 23:13 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Bas leaving cvi today

12/11/2021, 23:15 - Shivanshu Shekhar: You in placement cell ryt
12/11/2021, 23:15 - Shrey Shah: Tbh that depends man

In the same club if someone is really interested in it he will use the opportunities like crazy in it while most of them rot away doing manual work
12/11/2021, 23:15 - Bijo John: Ya, that's possible for tech clubs
12/11/2021, 23:15 - Shivanshu Shekhar: You will get t shirt for sure
12/11/2021, 23:15 - Bijo John: In non tech what opportunity anol 😂

12/11/2021, 23:16 - Shivanshu Shekhar: 🥲
12/11/2021, 23:17 - Shrey Shah: Take this example itself there are people in placement and intern team who just do it as a por whereas i know people who are in touch with everyone they coordinated with who got decent packages taking fundaes from them using them as contacts to apply

Take the case of start-up services
For me it's relatively more useless but people like Shashank who are entrepreneurship enthu he's regularly in touch with almost every VC or start-up founder he has come across
12/11/2021, 23:17 - Shrey Shah: He met one of them today itself
12/11/2021, 23:17 - Shrey Shah: Similar is for me in finance club
12/11/2021, 23:17 - Soumyadeep Kar: they give your shortlist for interns
12/11/2021, 23:17 - Soumyadeep Kar: which is huge
12/11/2021, 23:18 - Rushill Bairavan: <Media omitted>
12/11/2021, 23:18 - Shrey Shah: It's a relatively new club and is small compared to others but that's like huge opportunity for collabs and shit

12/11/2021, 23:18 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Endsems aarha hai
12/11/2021, 23:18 - Rushill Bairavan: Which shashank
12/11/2021, 23:18 - Bijo John: 'Using them as contacts' doesn't work at all
12/11/2021, 23:19 - Shrey Shah: Who said? 😂
12/11/2021, 23:19 - Soumyadeep Kar: civil

12/11/2021, 23:21 - Bijo John: Not 'no enthu'
12/11/2021, 23:21 - Rushill Bairavan: => No enthu for anything
12/11/2021, 23:21 - Bijo John: Not really
12/11/2021, 23:22 - Ruthika: Or enthu for everything?
12/11/2021, 23:22 - Bijo John: I'd call it 'still exploring'

You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all!
I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 Blitz World championships, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Tigran Petrosyan is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off...

Haha, if you "humans" (is that how you guys call people?) can "create" genders i'm sure i can complain about everything i want.

And why LGBT flag is a rainbow? I'm pretty sure rainbows are made when when the sun illuminates the humidity suspended in the air, after it rains, it's is not like: "brooo when the rain rain on the rain it makes a rainbow" or "broo when the sun burn the sun it makes a rainbow".

I can't believe LGBT is a real thing, it's probaly trolling. What is LGBT? L: Lol broo G: Great acting guys B: Btw people like us T: Tf they are weird
