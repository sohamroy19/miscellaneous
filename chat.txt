11/10/2021, 09:58 - +91 75590 68027: And csk is a team that prays throughout the tournament that they don't get MI in the finals
11/10/2021, 09:58 - +91 75590 68027: 🌚

11/10/2021, 11:14 - +91 75590 68027: Okay then , Csk is the bitch of a team full of actors with a sugar daddy.
11/10/2021, 11:14 - +91 75590 68027: Last time csk defeated mi in a final , Bjp had only 100 seats in India
11/10/2021, 11:14 - Ruthika: Happy Birthday @918928000005 🥳🥳
11/10/2021, 11:15 - Aditya S Sadhu: Exactly ambani modiji combo wasn't going full fledged, so csk won, which is obvious
11/10/2021, 11:15 - Harisankar K J: Oof 😂😂
11/10/2021, 11:15 - +91 75590 68027: Hmm and then for some reason,  Csk took a two year break from ipl
11/10/2021, 11:16 - +91 75590 68027: Was it a vacation from all the "success" you had then?
11/10/2021, 11:16 - Aditya S Sadhu: Brooo, every team in ipl fixes...ambani did well to keep it away from courts
11/10/2021, 11:17 - +91 75590 68027: Ooh nice comeback
11/10/2021, 11:17 - +91 75590 68027: I'm searching for my burnol here

11/10/2021, 11:22 - Aditya S Sadhu: 😂😂😂😂
11/10/2021, 11:23 - Ruban EE19: Guys come on. Even though sometimes the owners are involved in betting, the players are naturally talented. Just enjoy the game and the entertainment
11/10/2021, 11:24 - Aditya S Sadhu: When we consider just the players, csk is fireee
11/10/2021, 11:24 - Soham Roy: lol csk fan saying csk players get pocket money from ambani
11/10/2021, 11:25 - Ruban EE19: Agreed. Same applies for MI
11/10/2021, 11:25 - Aditya S Sadhu: Tbh if I get millions, I'd fix too nobody gives a shit bt honesty n stuff in ipl
11/10/2021, 11:26 - Soham Roy: doesn't take much to carry the same over to national teams tbh
11/10/2021, 11:26 - Manomukil T: Im saying all r getting pocket money
11/10/2021, 11:27 - Aditya S Sadhu: Well if u see the last 3 World cups, the host country just won...lol there are other reasons like home adv and everything but still something fishyy

11/10/2021, 11:29 - Nikhil S: nothing da they are planning ahead to vent out after they lose to kkr 😂
11/10/2021, 11:30 - Rama Manoj: No idea why they suck so much most of the time

11/10/2021, 11:31 - Aditya S Sadhu: It's bcuz 3 ppl used to hard carry the team and their bowling unit used to be shit, now that's not the case anymore, but now even they are sure that they suck so it continues
11/10/2021, 11:31 - +91 75590 68027: You had kohli ab Gayle in their prime , you still didn't win
11/10/2021, 11:31 - Rama Manoj: Oof F

11/10/2021, 11:32 - Aneesh Kandi: Yesss. Raina🥲
11/10/2021, 11:32 - Aditya S Sadhu: Doesn't matter, they'll choke
11/10/2021, 11:32 - Ashita Anil: Wait till 11pm no
11/10/2021, 11:32 - Ashita Anil: Why such unnecessary hate
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Aditya S Sadhu: No hate just history

11/10/2021, 11:33 - +91 75590 68027: Hmm 28 runs
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Ruban EE19: CSK had a great team in 2010-2015 period
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Aditya S Sadhu: But I am rly sad for Kohli tho, stepping down n all
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Aneesh Kandi: Harshal Patel 👌🏻
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Ashita Anil: Last series as captain 😭
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Aditya S Sadhu: Fireee it was
11/10/2021, 11:33 - Ruban EE19: Mi became a strong team in 2017-2021
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahhh everybody was in their prime and as always they batted till like no 10
11/10/2021, 11:34 - +91 75590 68027: Yup , especially 2020 , that was one of the most complete t20 team I've seen.
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Ruban EE19: Yeah
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Ashita Anil: Exactly
11/10/2021, 11:34 - +91 75590 68027: Everyone performed in some game
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Ashita Anil: All r in their prime ig
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Ashita Anil: 😳
11/10/2021, 11:34 - Ruban EE19: 2020 was purely MI's edition
11/10/2021, 11:35 - +91 75590 68027: Yeah , dominated every area.
Lmao dc was 0/3 in Q1
11/10/2021, 11:37 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Lmao 😂
11/10/2021, 11:37 - Ruban EE19: Why ppl praise CSK is mainly for their consistency
11/10/2021, 11:37 - Aneesh Kandi: 😂😂
11/10/2021, 11:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: The thing about cricket is its very unpredictable. In NBA, you almost know which teams are gonna make it to the playoffs and all, but in cricket any team might win against any team, irrespective of standings.
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Nikhil S: https://www.instagram.com/p/CU2cAQ7ho90/?utm_medium=share_sheet


Gautam gambhir!! 🙏🙏🙏
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: Some ppl consider trophies as the criteria for the best team, some ppl consider consistency. So it's completely based on your point of view
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Aditya S Sadhu: Wonder why that is
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Soham Roy: Also their jersey. I don't think I've ever seen such a bold yellow look good in cricket
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: 😂😂
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Ishaan Agarwal: If I asked you at the beginning of the season, which are the 4 teams who'd make it to the playoffs, there's no way you'd have predicted it right.
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Aneesh Kandi: Yes. Especially IPL. Everything is 🤯
11/10/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: This I'm not sure
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Rama Manoj: *3
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Rama Manoj: 99% csk will get in😂
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Rama Manoj: But I agree
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Aditya S Sadhu: I just wanna a see an ipl with 0 fixings just pure cricket
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Ishaan Agarwal: It most probably isn't fixed.
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: No, CSK sucked last year
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Aditya S Sadhu: Broo 😂
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Aditya S Sadhu: It most probably is
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Ruban EE19: Come on bro
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Ishaan Agarwal: The things you can fix are no balls and wides. What else?
11/10/2021, 11:39 - Ruban EE19: Only one year
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Ruban EE19: That's what i mean by consistency
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Ishaan Agarwal: You can't decide the outcome of the game by fixing. Unless the whole team is in on it.
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Soham Roy: every 5 years some owners get caught 😂
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Ruban EE19: And that's why he too mentioned 99 percent
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Aditya S Sadhu: Every year there are 2 teams clear long before the group stage is clear, and 1 team clears soo after and then 4 other teams fight for the 4th place till the very last game
11/10/2021, 11:40 - Aditya S Sadhu: Not once has the 4 teams been decided before the last game
11/10/2021, 11:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: I think that has more to do with the probability of that happening. It's kinda obvious 😂
11/10/2021, 11:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: 4 out of 8
11/10/2021, 11:41 - Aditya S Sadhu: It's not at all obv
11/10/2021, 11:41 - +91 75590 68027: You don't like la liga noe?
11/10/2021, 11:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: Has to be a tough fight for the 4th spot.
11/10/2021, 11:41 - Aditya S Sadhu: It's meant to be like that to give better betting odds
11/10/2021, 11:41 - +91 75590 68027: First three there also is fixed almost
11/10/2021, 11:42 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahhh lol sed but Barcelona this time☹️
11/10/2021, 11:42 - Soham Roy: there's also database management stuff
11/10/2021, 11:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: It's kind of like a normal distribution? So the mid placed teams fight harder for the 4th spot.
11/10/2021, 11:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: Whereas the top and bottom are clear
11/10/2021, 11:42 - Ishaan Agarwal: And most performance based events follow normal distributions.
11/10/2021, 11:43 - Aditya S Sadhu: See if you make 1 team lose a lot early on and 2 teams win early on, then the remaining are concentrated in the centre and they obv are in a fight leading to much better odds
11/10/2021, 11:44 - Chinmaya: Rcb gonna win today
11/10/2021, 11:44 - Aditya S Sadhu: 8 teams n all I don't think normal distribution works and definitely not everytime
11/10/2021, 11:44 - Aditya S Sadhu: Since the first season
11/10/2021, 11:44 - Aditya S Sadhu: Also u can fix so many things, it's very easy to bowl slot balls
11/10/2021, 11:45 - Ishaan Agarwal: But I seriously don't think the matches are fixed. I mean, how can you fix it? You can fix a ball or two, not the whole game.
11/10/2021, 11:45 - Aditya S Sadhu: And all the players are good enuf to convert them to sixers
11/10/2021, 11:45 - Chinmaya: This discussion again
11/10/2021, 11:45 - Ishaan Agarwal: If so many slot balls were bowled, it'd be obvious to the viewer. They bowl a lot of variations man.
11/10/2021, 11:46 - Ishaan Agarwal: You're telling me the batsman knows that the 3rd ball of the 17th over is gonna be a slot ball or something like that?
11/10/2021, 11:46 - +91 75590 68027: Yup to fix an entire tournament you need the consent of almost all players involved. That'd mean I shud doubt players like Dhoni , Sachin , Virat and Dravid. I can't do that🥲
11/10/2021, 11:46 - Aditya S Sadhu: Tbh most death over balls are very loose slot balls... nobody cares bt where the ball was bowled in death overs...only thing is whether it was a boundary or not
11/10/2021, 11:47 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahhh exactly which is the one single hope for me that the whole thing isn't fixed
11/10/2021, 11:47 - Aditya S Sadhu: We can call that pressure but idk
11/10/2021, 11:48 - +91 75590 68027: It's normal to lose your length when you're balling to good batsmen , it happens in every t20 league , even worldcup
11/10/2021, 11:49 - Aditya S Sadhu: Nooo not that specific...they keep the match tight till like the 14th over an based on the better they'll convey to the players who needs to win....batsmen might choke if the bowling team needs to win and bowlers can bowl slot balls if the batting team needs to win just an example
11/10/2021, 11:49 - Aditya S Sadhu: Truee 😂😂
11/10/2021, 11:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 11:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 11:50 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 11:51 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahhh but my point was that, the 4th team wasn't decided bfor the last or 2nd last game
11/10/2021, 11:51 - Ishaan Agarwal: nah man, I sincerely don't believe this. It's just not a game that can be scripted, in basketball the players can miss shots on purpose and no one would know, but I don't think you can script games like this in cricket.
11/10/2021, 11:51 - Aditya S Sadhu: Maybe thru rr or a single point
11/10/2021, 11:51 - Aditya S Sadhu: It very well can be lol...
11/10/2021, 11:51 - Aditya S Sadhu: Single win
11/10/2021, 11:52 - Ishaan Agarwal: and why do you think that's not probable enough?
11/10/2021, 11:52 - Ishaan Agarwal: if 4 teams are to make it out of 8, that data looks pretty standard to me.
11/10/2021, 11:52 - Aditya S Sadhu: Noo but why haven't we seen one edition where the top 4 teams have been decided before the last game...
11/10/2021, 11:53 - Aditya S Sadhu: How probable is that
11/10/2021, 11:53 - Ishaan Agarwal: very less I think.
11/10/2021, 11:53 - Soham Roy: Just watch InsideEdge ez
11/10/2021, 11:53 - Aditya S Sadhu: Oohhh is it nice

11/10/2021, 16:22 - Soham Roy: you probably installed mingw or something before that
11/10/2021, 16:24 - Bijo John: Ig you're talking about the extension, all it does is add some cool features such as code highlighting, intellisense and maybe the ability to run code in the editor, though this last bit needs a separate compiler to work
11/10/2021, 16:26 - Manomukil T: GCC is greater Chennai corporation
11/10/2021, 16:26 - Manomukil T: Don't always be in programming mode da

11/10/2021, 16:34 - Harisankar K J: Oof I thought mingw was for c only 😂😂😂
11/10/2021, 16:36 - Bijo John: Basically mingw is a software that brings in gcc to your system, gcc is a collection of C and C++ compilers

11/10/2021, 16:37 - Raunak P: No I wasn't attacking or whatever
11/10/2021, 16:37 - Bijo John: The gcc command is for C and not C++, but the entire collection of C and C++ compilers is called gcc as well
11/10/2021, 16:37 - Raunak P: Out of everyone I'd attack you the last when it comes to coding
11/10/2021, 16:37 - Raunak P: I was just

11/10/2021, 23:42 - Manomukil T: Takes some amt of pressure off him though
11/10/2021, 23:45 - Ruban EE19: True
11/10/2021, 23:46 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahh me too☹️, he deserves a trophy
11/10/2021, 23:46 - Ruban EE19: Especially for the way he played in 2016
11/10/2021, 23:46 - +91 75590 68027: Atleast he has trophies with national team
11/10/2021, 23:46 - +91 75590 68027: AB
11/10/2021, 23:46 - Ruban EE19: RCB of that season was something else
11/10/2021, 23:46 - +91 75590 68027: 🥺
11/10/2021, 23:47 - +91 75590 68027: Kohli was a different species in '16 , just 27 runs short of a 1000🔥
11/10/2021, 23:47 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeah he's a good captain...has a completely different style compared to dhoni, but I personally like him as a batsman than a captain
11/10/2021, 23:47 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahh beast mode🔥🔥, every single game he got going
11/10/2021, 23:48 - +91 75590 68027: Hmm yeah , but I meant AB doesn't have any trophies at all🥲
11/10/2021, 23:48 - Aditya S Sadhu: Ahhh the next msg, I missed that....yeah and AB wtd....some legends go trophyless
11/10/2021, 23:49 - Ruban EE19: Yeah
11/10/2021, 23:49 - Aditya S Sadhu: Wait, he doesn't as a captain right or am I mistaken?
11/10/2021, 23:50 - Aditya S Sadhu: Virat I mean
11/10/2021, 23:50 - +91 75590 68027: Not as a captain , but he has a WC anol noe
11/10/2021, 23:50 - Ruban EE19: Would've been a remarkable feat if he had scored 1000 runs
11/10/2021, 23:50 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeahhh that yeahh
11/10/2021, 23:50 - +91 75590 68027: Yah man , here players are struggling to cross 500
11/10/2021, 23:50 - Ruban EE19: Exactly
11/10/2021, 23:51 - Ruban EE19: And he hit 4 hundreds in that season
11/10/2021, 23:51 - Ruban EE19: 2016 was a golden year for Kohli
11/10/2021, 23:51 - Aditya S Sadhu: Wait so, this T20 world cup, is Virat the captain?
11/10/2021, 23:51 - +91 75590 68027: Hmm yes , his last tournament as t20 cap it seems
11/10/2021, 23:52 - +91 75590 68027: Yup in all formats , had like 3 double hundreds in tests.
And 128 smth average in t20 wc
11/10/2021, 23:52 - Aditya S Sadhu: Ahh okk...he needs to clutch this up cuz next odi wc is 2023 and I don't think he will be able to retain captaincy until then if he doesn't clutch this
11/10/2021, 23:52 - Aditya S Sadhu: Given the pressure from team mates n mgmt

11/10/2021, 23:53 - Ruthika: Hmm
11/10/2021, 23:55 - +91 75590 68027: Hmm maybe we'll win , everytime we go with an in-form team and we choke. This time it's not that great so who knows
11/10/2021, 23:55 - Aditya S Sadhu: Yeah truee...underdog mentality always helps
11/10/2021, 23:56 - Aditya S Sadhu: India isn't exactly an underdog but isn't a favourite as well ig
11/10/2021, 23:56 - +91 75590 68027: England and WI are truly intimidating tho
11/10/2021, 23:56 - +91 75590 68027: Yeah def not favorites

Any ideas how to fix this?

12/10/2021, 09:53 - +91 93510 13618: Yeah but chat even chat is also not there

13/10/2021, 15:18 - Purvam Jain: Why don't people rent rooms outside campus instead of hostels? You have more freedom that way🤷🏻‍♂️
13/10/2021, 15:33 - Soham Roy: The amount of people that would be moving through the gates every day would probably be a logistical nigthmare
13/10/2021, 15:34 - Purvam Jain: From a students perspective
13/10/2021, 15:36 - Soham Roy: Wait in line at 8 am when you're late for class, ez
13/10/2021, 15:37 - Rahul Desai: Wouldn't that be same as schools?
13/10/2021, 15:37 - Soham Roy: schools have many students coming in buses
13/10/2021, 15:38 - Soham Roy: also school uniform vs ID checking for college students
13/10/2021, 15:38 - Purvam Jain: No u ll be living alone or with a roomate
13/10/2021, 15:39 - Purvam Jain: Not everyone is choosing for that though, I meant to ask why most people opt for hostels?
13/10/2021, 15:39 - Purvam Jain: When facilities are so bad
13/10/2021, 15:39 - Soham Roy: hostels are compulsory here right
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Purvam Jain: Not sure,  some Iits have mandatory
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Soham Roy: $$$ and proximity
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Purvam Jain: Some don't
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Soham Roy: I'm pretty sure all old IITs have compulsory
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Purvam Jain: Is it really that expensive though? Not sure about proximity yes
13/10/2021, 15:40 - Purvam Jain: Delhi doesn't
13/10/2021, 15:41 - Nikhil S: No idts.
13/10/2021, 15:41 - Purvam Jain: Are there such facilities near campus? Chennai people
13/10/2021, 15:41 - Nikhil S: We can choose to be a day scholar right.. In the fees payment they asked day scholar or hosteller
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Soham Roy: that's for phd peeps right
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Bijo John: But you miss the hostel experience
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Bijo John: And rooms are usually more expensive
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Bijo John: Yeah, significantly more expensive
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Purvam Jain: What hostel experience?
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Soham Roy: our hostel fees are about 20k persem, right
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Purvam Jain: Ah like by how much does it differ?
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Bijo John: That's something I've tried and failed to explain to you
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Purvam Jain: Yes
13/10/2021, 15:42 - Rahul Desai: Iit Delhi has AC rooms itseems na
13/10/2021, 15:43 - Nikhil S: Is it? I am not sure tho.. I talked to one senior and he was like why can't you  guys  be day scholars and come to college!
13/10/2021, 15:43 - Purvam Jain: Independence will be there
Also u might have a roommate
What else?
13/10/2021, 15:43 - Bijo John: A room in chennai is gonna cost a fair deal, actual chennai peeps can provide better insight
13/10/2021, 15:43 - Soham Roy: If you share a 2 bhk with 4 people it would probably cost 40k per sem in IIT locality (prime metropolis) I'm guessing
13/10/2021, 15:43 - Rahul Desai: 40k for 2bhk?

13/10/2021, 15:44 - Shivanshu Shekhar: You will pay more for renting
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Depends on hotel. Usually 1k-2k per day
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Purvam Jain: Ok😳
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Bijo John: Hard to put in words, but it's an amazing experience
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Jayanth B: If u want to stay in Hyaat. It'll cost a bit
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Soham Roy: 40k for 6 months for 4 people, assuming 25k per month
13/10/2021, 15:44 - Bijo John: Hyatt aa 😂

13/10/2021, 15:45 - Purvam Jain: Where did u check these figures tho
13/10/2021, 15:45 - Rahul Desai: That's still too much na 🥴 
And moreover you'll need to hire a cook and a maid too
13/10/2021, 15:45 - Bijo John: Some things can't be objectively described
13/10/2021, 15:46 - Purvam Jain: U can cook and clean urself
13/10/2021, 15:46 - Bijo John: Those are pretty reasonable numbers for a metro city
13/10/2021, 15:46 - Soham Roy: Saying hostel doesn't matter in IIT is like saying the only thing remarkable about starbucks is the coffee
13/10/2021, 15:46 - Bijo John: 😂😂
13/10/2021, 15:47 - Rahul Desai: 🥴 
What about electricity bill? 
Should I run on a hamster wheel? 🥴
13/10/2021, 15:47 - Purvam Jain: Sadly I can't see the point 😕
13/10/2021, 15:47 - Soham Roy: I live pretty far from iitb and a decent 2 bhk near me costs 20k per month, so I assumed
13/10/2021, 15:47 - Soham Roy: yeah that stuff adds up

13/10/2021, 22:50 - Rahul Desai: Fmab is far better 
But it didn't get this much recognition 🙂
13/10/2021, 22:51 - Rahul Desai: I'm not telling aot is bad 
It's just that it has too much hype for that anime 🥴
13/10/2021, 22:53 - Rakshit Pandey: FMAB is a masterpiece no doubt , but AoT is equally great imo and in my opinion aot is peak edge of the seat thriller 🙂

15/10/2021, 11:59 - Purvam Jain: Read this?
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Raunak P: You calm bro
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: Yes
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Raunak P: We are still in IITm
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: Obviously
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: Powai is in a diff league
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Ishaan Agarwal: I thought Delhi~Bombay~Madras~Kanpur~KGP in terms of placements.
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: No
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Raunak P: There will be smth good
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: Bombay best
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Aniruddha EE: By the way... Did anyone here decide already if u wanna go for placements or masters?
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Bijo John: Idk, bombay is way better in terms of internships, by extension they have an edge in placements
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Purvam Jain: I wish I took dual ee there
15/10/2021, 12:00 - Ishaan Agarwal: What about Delhi?
15/10/2021, 12:00 - +91 93913 14961: Did you?
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Purvam Jain: Yes I got PPO from nvidia Adobe Facebook Google microsoft
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Bijo John: IITM elec offers an insane amount of freedom, that's worth it imo
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Purvam Jain: Better than madras
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Purvam Jain: But don't like the city so
15/10/2021, 12:01 - +91 93913 14961: I didn't
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Purvam Jain: Didn't choose
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Bijo John: No connections there, but prolly better
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Aniruddha EE: no obv lol
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why
15/10/2021, 12:01 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why prolly better?
15/10/2021, 12:02 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why keep it restricted to just two options 😔
15/10/2021, 12:02 - Bijo John: Still undecided lol, I was pretty sure of placements till like maybe 2 months ago, now I'm hesitant. Maybe a DD would be my way
15/10/2021, 12:03 - Bijo John: Avg rank of students better -> companies expect better ig
15/10/2021, 12:03 - Bijo John: No idea
15/10/2021, 12:03 - Purvam Jain: Alum
15/10/2021, 12:03 - Purvam Jain: Ni
15/10/2021, 12:03 - Aniruddha EE: what other options? like quiiting engineering and doing wildlife photography?
15/10/2021, 12:04 - Bijo John: PhD maybe
15/10/2021, 12:04 - Aniruddha EE: phd only after masters/dd na. i asked about immediate plan after btech
15/10/2021, 12:04 - Bijo John: Ah
15/10/2021, 12:05 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: ++about the undecided part. Dilli abhi door hai
15/10/2021, 12:06 - Aniruddha EE: what min requirements do we have for getting DD?
15/10/2021, 12:06 - Bijo John: Only a CG cutoff... 8.5 iirc
15/10/2021, 12:07 - Bijo John: Or is it 7.5
15/10/2021, 12:07 - Bijo John: But if you choose DD, doing a project becomes compulsory
15/10/2021, 12:08 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Jharkhand gets 150 max😂
15/10/2021, 12:08 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Open a factory bro
15/10/2021, 12:09 - Shivanshu Shekhar: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:09 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: This is an another option
15/10/2021, 12:09 - Rama Manoj: Lmao
15/10/2021, 12:10 - Bijo John: There are so many people doing YouTube coaching after IIT na 😂😂
15/10/2021, 12:11 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Hate those people always misleading for views
15/10/2021, 12:11 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: .
15/10/2021, 12:12 - Ishaan Agarwal: Why not.
15/10/2021, 12:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: I mean, why restrict it to just two options.
15/10/2021, 12:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Placements or Further studies.
15/10/2021, 12:13 - Ishaan Agarwal: Like tf
15/10/2021, 12:13 - Bijo John: Other options don't seem lucrative enough for the vast majority 😞
15/10/2021, 12:14 - Rama Manoj: Other options come with extra benefits such as being abandoned by the family and ending up an outcast, and sometimes the excellent starvation dlc
15/10/2021, 12:14 - Bijo John: This is why almost everyone is here, you need really strong reason to abandon it
15/10/2021, 12:14 - Rama Manoj: Guess I'm vast majority then
15/10/2021, 12:14 - Bijo John: 😂😂
15/10/2021, 12:14 - Rama Manoj: ++
15/10/2021, 12:14 - +91 79896 22077: 😂😂
15/10/2021, 12:15 - Keerthana Rachuri: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:15 - Ishaan Agarwal: So most of you are here for the lucrative placements?
15/10/2021, 12:15 - Bijo John: Yes
15/10/2021, 12:15 - Rama Manoj: Reliable placements, not lucrative
15/10/2021, 12:16 - Rama Manoj: I don't want to be rich
15/10/2021, 12:16 - Rama Manoj: I want to be independent
15/10/2021, 12:16 - Bijo John: Ah, this
15/10/2021, 12:16 - Ishaan Agarwal: Mmmhmmm
15/10/2021, 12:17 - Nikhil S: That's like a pyramid scheme. Getting into iit and then making many other get into iit 😤
15/10/2021, 12:17 - Bijo John: 😂
15/10/2021, 12:18 - Rama Manoj: Yeah, f them
15/10/2021, 12:18 - Rama Manoj: Telling the same lies told to them
15/10/2021, 12:18 - Ishaan Agarwal: LiFe AfTeR cRaCkInG IIT.
15/10/2021, 12:19 - Bijo John: Prolly we'd do the same if juniors ask during their coaching lol
15/10/2021, 12:19 - Rama Manoj: I wouldn't coach in the first place
15/10/2021, 12:19 - Snehitha Andapally: This message was deleted
15/10/2021, 12:19 - Rama Manoj: I know this is a scam
15/10/2021, 12:20 - Bijo John: Eyy not that, suppose you go to your school and then some junior asks
15/10/2021, 12:20 - Purvam Jain: Financial security?
15/10/2021, 12:20 - Rama Manoj: All I would say is spread your cheeks for the courses and hope they are done quick
15/10/2021, 12:20 - Bijo John: 😂
15/10/2021, 12:20 - Bijo John: Interesting analogy
15/10/2021, 12:21 - Rama Manoj: Nice pun
15/10/2021, 12:21 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:21 - Saurav Kale: Lmao
15/10/2021, 12:21 - Saurav Kale: 😂😂😂😂😂
15/10/2021, 12:22 - Saurav Kale: Bro... Like not all is bad ok... It's like... People hype up. But ya the level of engineering is good only na. Only campus is being denied to ppl so we can't see it happen. But overall, I would recommend this to anyone whose genuinely into engineering.
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Ishaan Agarwal: Are any of us here genuinely into engineering?
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Rama Manoj: Was about to say this
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Rama Manoj: Me no
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Purvam Jain: We're u into engineering already b4 u started preparing for jee?
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Nikhil S: ✌🏼
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Saurav Kale: Me, yes. I love it. It hurts, but I'll take it.
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Purvam Jain: Not at all
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Saurav Kale: I was.
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Rama Manoj: 🌚
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Purvam Jain: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Bijo John: Yeah same... but the facts are never laid out in full to the juniors, they always seem to think life in iit is chill
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Saurav Kale: Lmao
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Ishaan Agarwal: Bruh 😂
15/10/2021, 12:23 - Purvam Jain: Oh
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Rama Manoj: I'm here because I hate the idea of being a doctor more
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Bijo John: 😂
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Rama Manoj: That's it
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Purvam Jain: What made u pursue engineering?
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Saurav Kale: I used to toy around with arduinos and all before... Electronics was a big part of my life before also...
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Purvam Jain: I like biology more than mathematics lol
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Bijo John: Seems better than the other options, both in terms of learning and prospects
15/10/2021, 12:24 - Rama Manoj: Me too, but being a doctor seems stressful af
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Purvam Jain: 🙏🏻still now I haven't touched arduino
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Rama Manoj: Emgineer
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Bijo John: Dw arduinos are for kids :)
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Purvam Jain: Yes I was scared by the rote learning of those thick books and studying for 10 years?
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Saurav Kale: Basically I used to love making cool projects in electronics in my school days... Loved making games... My math was horrendous but I had enthu lol
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: I was totally. Even now I do. But its fading for sure.
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Rama Manoj: Agree, the problem is education hurts in general
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Bijo John: True 😂
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Rama Manoj: Kinda
15/10/2021, 12:25 - Saurav Kale: True
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Purvam Jain: Ok
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Saurav Kale: My parents almost convinced me to take medicine
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Purvam Jain: My family didn't want me to pursue bio
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Saurav Kale: Actually it would have been perfect... Heir to a pre-made setup is like... A huge head start.
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Nikhil S: Don't you think that if we  start to genuinely like what we  are studying we would stop bitching about it more
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Saurav Kale: But that's not what I wanted to do.
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Rama Manoj: If someone guarantees me enough to live okayishly , a laptop, a mobile and internet, I will give up rn
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Saurav Kale: True.
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Rama Manoj: Edu is cringe
15/10/2021, 12:26 - Purvam Jain: For life😂
15/10/2021, 12:27 - Bijo John: True, but genuinely liking it is easier said than done
15/10/2021, 12:27 - Saurav Kale: See guys rn your courses are very basic ok... It'll seem like a lot of grunt work
15/10/2021, 12:27 - Saurav Kale: But they have excellent and VERY interesting follow ups
15/10/2021, 12:27 - Purvam Jain: I am just waiting for ee courses to get over! I like hs courses more rn
15/10/2021, 12:27 - Saurav Kale: Which are very practical, and real applications of what you're learning rn. Second year is groundwork of EE.
15/10/2021, 12:28 - Bijo John: The only course I genuinely like rn is 2016 (though I'm no fan of the eval procedure)
15/10/2021, 12:28 - Rama Manoj: You are acting like genuinely liking is a conscious decision we can take
15/10/2021, 12:28 - Rama Manoj: Not possible
15/10/2021, 12:28 - Rama Manoj: Imo
15/10/2021, 12:28 - Bijo John: Will have to sit through analog next sem, and if I don't find that interesting, I'm gonna delve into digital
15/10/2021, 12:29 - Rama Manoj: 😓
15/10/2021, 12:29 - Saurav Kale: Well. I'd say arguable. I hated EE till 4th sem.
15/10/2021, 12:29 - Rama Manoj: Would have been good if it was split into two courses imo
15/10/2021, 12:29 - Saurav Kale: Don't base your love for analog from ANALOG SYSTEMS at all
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Saurav Kale: Everyone hates analog systems
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Nikhil S: Not actually I mean out of 5 courses atleast if you like 2 or 3.. Genuinely  study it with passion and once you are done with that go to others.. I will give an example, I mean I haven't done it but we all bitch about not given the opportunity to do 2016 lab irl, sometimes.. But if we check there's an option for arduino interface in microchip studio as well so if we would have explored more we can as well try to do all that we the arduino we have.. This is just an example but still I hope you get the point
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Rama Manoj: Yeah you did, and now you like it, these are consequences ,not decisions
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Bijo John: Maybe, you can hypnotise yourself into liking something, though it's not easy by any means
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Saurav Kale: Even the pros
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Bijo John: F
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Saurav Kale: I decided to give it a chance. It was a concious choice.
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Rama Manoj: You lost me at line 3😭
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Rama Manoj: I can't, as usual I suck
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Rama Manoj: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:30 - Saurav Kale: Once you delve into things further... That's when you get if you really love it or not.
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Saurav Kale: If you base your liking just on courses and their curricula and don't delve further... I feel we are shutting out things which could be potentially very life changing
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Bijo John: One constraint here is time, it's very hard to find time to explore beyond the syllabus unless you're super dedicated
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Saurav Kale: Yes that it true...
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Saurav Kale: It's not like we are given enough time to explore
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Saurav Kale: We are not.
15/10/2021, 12:31 - Rama Manoj: And motivation
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Saurav Kale: But we can try.
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Rama Manoj: I have none of it rn to explore
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Rahul Desai: Yoooooo
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Purvam Jain: What if we already like something else? Hence don't like ee?
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Bijo John: Eyy self-hypnosis is kinda military grade stuff 😂
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Rama Manoj: I have been studying for exams and exams only since so long
15/10/2021, 12:32 - Saurav Kale: That's okay. Explore that then
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Rama Manoj: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Rama Manoj: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Rama Manoj: This
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Bijo John: But then choosing ee was a bad move 😞
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Purvam Jain: Ye lol can't graduate otherwise
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Purvam Jain: Can't go to aiims by clearing jee😕
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Saurav Kale: EE eval is hectic... Ya that's true... You don't get much time to explore other stuff... At least not as much as other branches lol
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Purvam Jain: Like who knew ee was this bad
15/10/2021, 12:33 - Saurav Kale: But then ik people among you who balance things very well.
15/10/2021, 12:34 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: ....You wanted to be a doctor?
15/10/2021, 12:34 - Saurav Kale: Some have done this so well that they've inspired me.
15/10/2021, 12:34 - Bijo John: EE is great, the eval is bad
15/10/2021, 12:34 - Purvam Jain: No I am just giving an example
15/10/2021, 12:34 - Purvam Jain: Like you can't chose something other than engineering or branch ur rank qualified for
15/10/2021, 12:35 - Purvam Jain: Hmm I don't like any courses tho😕
15/10/2021, 12:35 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Yee being decisive early is not always the case too
15/10/2021, 12:35 - Shivanshu Shekhar: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:35 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Life skills lesgo
15/10/2021, 12:36 - Purvam Jain: See if I don't like these"basic courses" I can't see myself enjoying advanced course
15/10/2021, 12:36 - Bijo John: Basic courses are almost always shit
15/10/2021, 12:37 - Bijo John: The advanced courses are way more application based, definitely more interesting
15/10/2021, 12:37 - Purvam Jain: Why do you think advanced code will be interesting
15/10/2021, 12:37 - Purvam Jain: Still we will be reading theory ryt
15/10/2021, 12:37 - Purvam Jain: Not like we will be making something
15/10/2021, 12:38 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Communication is fun
15/10/2021, 12:38 - Shivanshu Shekhar: *for me
15/10/2021, 12:38 - Purvam Jain: 2025?
15/10/2021, 12:40 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 12:40 - Bijo John: Not always, courses like comporg actually force you to build your own device, which is not the same as reading theory
15/10/2021, 12:40 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: I didn't mean that, I meant like going , "I want to be a doctor" before 10th is not the case always.
15/10/2021, 12:40 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Its difficult but yes most application based
15/10/2021, 12:41 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Also i was talking about qkd
15/10/2021, 12:49 - Raunak P: Give names
15/10/2021, 12:50 - Saurav Kale: You know them already
15/10/2021, 12:56 - Rama Manoj: F them😡, Im jealous
15/10/2021, 12:57 - Srichandra: 😔 I suck at this
15/10/2021, 12:57 - Saurav Kale: Me too.
15/10/2021, 12:57 - Raunak P: That what she sais
15/10/2021, 12:57 - Raunak P: Said*
15/10/2021, 12:57 - Saurav Kale: Lmao
15/10/2021, 12:58 - Rama Manoj: Lol
15/10/2021, 12:58 - Saurav Kale: Fuck yaar. Sub juniors 😶. Fuck. Years are just racing by 🥲

15/10/2021, 12:59 - Rama Manoj: 😂😂😂😂😂
15/10/2021, 13:00 - Rama Manoj: Close your eyes and we all will be working 6 days a week in cubicles batching about stress to our colleagues
15/10/2021, 13:00 - Rama Manoj: Can't forget the glorious spondylitis for being confined to chairs

17/10/2021, 12:58 - Ashita Anil: *Weekend Programming Sessions:*

Intrigued by puzzles? Fascinated by algorithms? Or you want to learn some *DSA* to apply for an SDE profile? Whether you are a beginner in Competitive Programming or you are an *Expert* there is something for all at WPS.

At WPS, we aim to provide each and every individual with problems and *regular* sessions that would help them to learn some amazing algorithms and get to greater heights.

The session would be conducted separately for 2 groups G1 and G2. In G1 we will be focusing more on problem-solving and solve some good-level problems. While for G2 you can expect sessions on advanced topics and some really good problems to solve. Kindly refer to the schedules for both groups to get more clarity.

All sessions except for the first one, will be for 2 hours and conducted on weekends, Saturday (for G1) and Sunday (for G2). The first session will be conducted on 18th Oct (Monday).

Open to all who are enthusiastic about Coding and Competitive Programming, and no other prerequisite 🤘🏻.

The deadline to register for WPS is *21st October 11:59 PM.*

This could your opportunity to get into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms or become better at it. So don't wait for the right time,  join in before  *"Time Limit Exceeds"*.

19/10/2021, 14:13 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: I feel D
19/10/2021, 14:13 - Harisankar K J: D ig
19/10/2021, 14:14 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Because I think, in B torque factor won't keep it straight
19/10/2021, 14:14 - Nikhil S: Shouldn't they give how the air resistance is changing or not changing with height?

19/10/2021, 14:15 - Harisankar K J: It is considered ideal..hence no air resistance considered
19/10/2021, 14:15 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: It is considered
19/10/2021, 14:15 - Harisankar K J: Oh nvm they mentioned it 😂😂
19/10/2021, 14:16 - Ishaan Agarwal: For any small element on the rope, Horizontal component of T remains same i.e to balance air drag. But vertical component decreases coz below weight decreases. Angle with horizontal is say, x, then Tcosx= constant, and as T has decreased, x must also decrease. So I think C.
19/10/2021, 14:16 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: The bottommost point should point downward imo, as it doesn't has tension due to weight
19/10/2021, 14:17 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: <Media omitted>

19/10/2021, 14:18 - Ishaan Agarwal: v same.
19/10/2021, 14:18 - Chinmaya: Is that circle type thing the ball?
19/10/2021, 14:18 - Bijo John: B varies with air density, dk if I'm overthinking
19/10/2021, 14:18 - Chinmaya: The wheel*
19/10/2021, 14:18 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Bijo John: Body of helicopter
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Ishaan Agarwal: Eyy why JEE PTSD, be IITians. 
"This question is very easy. You'd have solved it during JEE"
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ggez
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Nikhil S: C seems correct considering the lower most point with the tension, small mg and air resistance towards left..
19/10/2021, 14:19 - Bijo John: ++
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Chinmaya: Ok I think it's D too
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Nah answer is d fs
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Chinmaya: Tension at the top of cable will be towards left
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Bijo John: Why d? No weight at bottom -> no downward T na
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Chinmaya: That's y
19/10/2021, 14:20 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: The tension at the middle point is inward for D but outward for c
19/10/2021, 14:21 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: It should be inwards so as to balance outwards drag
19/10/2021, 14:21 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Like taking the resultant of the two tensions on the arc
19/10/2021, 14:22 - Bijo John: In both cases it points approx 45 degree downwards and backwards na
19/10/2021, 14:22 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: But curvature matters for left or right tension
19/10/2021, 14:22 - Bijo John: ?
19/10/2021, 14:23 - Bijo John: T along tangent na
19/10/2021, 14:23 - Nikhil S: Veritasium asked this q yesterday
19/10/2021, 14:23 - Bijo John: 😯
19/10/2021, 14:23 - Chinmaya: ++++±
19/10/2021, 14:24 - Harisankar K J: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:24 - Chinmaya: Lmao gg
19/10/2021, 14:24 - Chinmaya: Veritasium is wrong
19/10/2021, 14:24 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: 
19/10/2021, 14:24 - Chinmaya: IITM students disagree
19/10/2021, 14:25 - Bijo John: What's this thing perpendicular to T?
19/10/2021, 14:25 - Harisankar K J: Pls explain🙃
19/10/2021, 14:25 - Soham Roy: @916353931453's D is correct for heavy chain
19/10/2021, 14:25 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Two tensions generate a net tension inward for D case
19/10/2021, 14:25 - Soham Roy: I assumed light chain
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Chinmaya: Yes that's the assumption
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Chinmaya: They said cable anol
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Soham Roy: Although I'm only speculating, not solving
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Chinmaya: Well soham got it right, so much be that approach
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Bijo John: Tension on a rope is always along the length, never perpendicular
19/10/2021, 14:26 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: That's not tension man, the resultant force due to two tensions
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Soham Roy: 😂😭
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Tension is always along the rope
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Bijo John: 🥴
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: But due to curvature, a resultant force develops, ie upper tension and lower tension won't be same
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Bijo John: Two tensions act on separate points, how would there be a resultant?
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: dx approximations and taking dm
19/10/2021, 14:27 - Soham Roy: do it in a bucket of water with your hand and a noodle
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Lambda*dx
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Soham Roy: end up with correct answer D and maggi
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Bijo John: Still two separate points
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Soham Roy: do instead with a string and you get B I feel
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Deii take it as a mass daa
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: And apply two forces won't at edges
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: To it*
19/10/2021, 14:28 - Chinmaya: @917550143818 question came from where
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Bijo John: See, at the bottom there's no mass, so string must point left na
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Soham Roy: no
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Bijo John: Why
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Soham Roy: at bottom point friction is also not acting enough
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Yaaa mass is damn low
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Soham Roy: if friction per length is k at that point, friction would still be 0 at bottom
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Hence no tension
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Bijo John: Assume the very last element dx
19/10/2021, 14:29 - Soham Roy: at the top, friction is integral of k from top to bottom
19/10/2021, 14:30 - Bijo John: Length -> friction, lack of mass below it -> no downward tension
19/10/2021, 14:30 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Sorry negligible tension only in up direction, no friction effects
19/10/2021, 14:30 - Soham Roy: idk i don't trust mathematicians
19/10/2021, 14:30 - Bijo John: How would there be any upward tension
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Due to very small mass
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Bijo John: Where, below it?
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Also think it in terms of curvature
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Soham Roy: of it
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Bijo John: It's own mass doesn't cause tension
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Not in terms of last point mass
19/10/2021, 14:31 - Soham Roy: ???
19/10/2021, 14:32 - Bijo John: Mass of one element is supported by tension of elements above it, not by tension in itself
19/10/2021, 14:32 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Yaa yaa ofc
19/10/2021, 14:32 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: ..
19/10/2021, 14:32 - Soham Roy: what about unbalanced weight dx * linear mass density * g then
19/10/2021, 14:32 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: It doesn't matter for last point element, it will be dictated by curvature
19/10/2021, 14:33 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: As far as my imagination points, it should be concave right as pointed by D for mass cable 😂
19/10/2021, 14:34 - Bijo John: dx is assumed to be small enough that this effect can be neglected ig
19/10/2021, 14:35 - Bijo John: An element of integration is always chosen such that the property of interest remains constant on it
19/10/2021, 14:35 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Also bijo in C the top point can't be vertical
19/10/2021, 14:35 - Chinmaya: ~integration~ bijo
~interest~ toppets
19/10/2021, 14:35 - Chinmaya: Toppers*
19/10/2021, 14:36 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: As that point is in contact with helicopter, the normal provided by helicopter will balance the mg, hence tangential tension is needed to balance the max drag
19/10/2021, 14:36 - Bijo John: Air resistance small compared to weight, so not perfectly vertical ig, but close
19/10/2021, 14:36 - Bijo John: ???
19/10/2021, 14:36 - Bijo John: Helicopter doesn't provide any pulling force
19/10/2021, 14:36 - Bijo John: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:37 - Soham Roy: Effect of dx is neglected on x, not on dx itself
19/10/2021, 14:37 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: See bottom masses are experiencing drag ryt, so their impact will reach the top point
19/10/2021, 14:37 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: As soham said, integrate the drag imo
19/10/2021, 14:38 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Treat the whole mass below the point as a block mass and draw FBD, ig will become clear
19/10/2021, 14:39 - Bijo John: How does the drag add up? Helicopter has to balance the net drag on all elements, fine, but why would drag on one affect the other?
19/10/2021, 14:40 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Because it's a rigid cable and is connected?? 🤔
19/10/2021, 14:40 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Like vanderwall to the rescue
19/10/2021, 14:41 - Nipun EE: Ah
19/10/2021, 14:41 - Nipun EE: This is why I hated physics in jee
19/10/2021, 14:41 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
19/10/2021, 14:43 - Aniruddha EE: imo this argument justifies option B. thedrag force on a part of the wire is prop to its vertical projection length. and weight is prop to the total length.
19/10/2021, 14:48 - AMS Gentleman: Figured it out??
19/10/2021, 14:48 - Bijo John: Actually yeah, now that I think of it
19/10/2021, 14:49 - Bijo John: Assuming air resistance remains constant as well

20/10/2021, 13:19 - Bijo John: Ah, our factory sends a new faculty for each topic, so you usually get a mix of good and bad, unless your branch is particularly unlucky
20/10/2021, 13:19 - Nikhil S: Yeah I don't remember what came in adv but for mains it was just purely ncert
20/10/2021, 13:19 - Bijo John: But of course

So learning organic with me was kinda fun.. But inorganic he just like that gave notes and thats it.. I mean nothing more can be done but still..
20/10/2021, 13:22 - Nikhil S: Learning organic with him*
20/10/2021, 13:22 - Bijo John: Yo some profs make inorganic super fun, we had a really cool guy for 11th p block

22/10/2021, 19:04 - Bijo John: Ofc, but ee offers a far wider field to play with
22/10/2021, 19:04 - Saurav Kale: Bro the thing is you can't look thru the tunnel vision of just one thing which is good for you and recommend that for everyone
22/10/2021, 19:04 - Saurav Kale: That's what everyone does I feel and it leads to heavy misinformation.
22/10/2021, 19:04 - Bijo John: ++ depends on each person
22/10/2021, 19:04 - Purvam Jain: Then how can you recommend d ee?
22/10/2021, 19:04 - Purvam Jain: That way u can't recomned

22/10/2021, 19:05 - Saurav Kale: EE has more places you can go to
22/10/2021, 19:05 - Bijo John: True, but what we can do is put hard facts on display, and describe your experience
22/10/2021, 19:06 - Purvam Jain: Yes and personally I don't like ee that's all and if that boy wants placements cse is better
22/10/2021, 19:06 - Saurav Kale: That's what may matter to you.. doesn't mean it matters for everyone. That's the point. People do education because they want a job. This mentality itself is wrong. Learn something because you want to learn it. Not because of any kind of monetary gain. Ofc it is important and it has its part. But you shouldn't. And general won't be able to do complete justice to anything unless you really like it.
22/10/2021, 19:06 - Raunak P: i had same doubt

22/10/2021, 19:07 - Raunak P: clearly
22/10/2021, 19:07 - Bijo John: Assuming you're not talking just about salary
22/10/2021, 19:07 - Rama Manoj: The audacity, mf thinks he will see campus
22/10/2021, 19:07 - Bijo John: In terms of salary yeah, cs should be better
22/10/2021, 19:07 - Shrey Shah: XD
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Shivanshu Shekhar: 🫂
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Purvam Jain: See most people believe in income only that's the reason for high demand of these so called "upper branches" because of salary and u urself said no one has any idea about subject sister people believe in salary no matter how unethical it sounds
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Purvam Jain: Median salary is higher ryt?
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Shrey Shah: Salary lite
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Saurav Kale: Ya they do. Because that's the only metric people get.
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Mohith Mvs: Sounds true
22/10/2021, 19:08 - Purvam Jain: Most people would disagree
22/10/2021, 19:09 - Purvam Jain: What else do u want them to base their choice on?
22/10/2021, 19:09 - Rama Manoj: Ah nice
22/10/2021, 19:09 - Saurav Kale: I'm saying we do not inculcate interest for anything before btech. I'm not saying thinking like that is wrong. I'm saying we as a society make students think in this way. Because there is no other metric
22/10/2021, 19:09 - Rama Manoj: System is really horny
22/10/2021, 19:09 - Rushill Bairavan: Most people will put up with something for good money, unless they really hate it
22/10/2021, 19:10 - Bijo John: Yeah, at first glance salary is the only metric one has to judge a branch, but as students who've done ee and know cs peeps, we can see the benefits to taking ee, and we can explain that to others as well
22/10/2021, 19:10 - Purvam Jain: Ah we can always divert everything to educational system in India lol
22/10/2021, 19:10 - Saurav Kale: True
22/10/2021, 19:10 - Purvam Jain: This didn't happen in 70 years of iit I highly doubt this
22/10/2021, 19:11 - Purvam Jain: U can try ofc👌🏻
22/10/2021, 19:11 - Bijo John: Yeah people still haven't realised
22/10/2021, 19:11 - Bijo John: And idt india is gonna change anytime soon 🥲
22/10/2021, 19:11 - Saurav Kale: There are some benefits to being an EE compared to being totally into CS... You have more options.
22/10/2021, 19:11 - Purvam Jain: World is driven by money simple🤷🏻‍♂️
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Purvam Jain: U might tell this but most students if they are getting Cs they will choose that I feel
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Bijo John: Sus, ik a guy who got AIR 87 and chose EP
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Rama Manoj: Idk why people are so crazy for those huge packages tbh, I'm personally a don't starve enthusiast, and all these guys going crazy over coding make me rethink my life choices
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Purvam Jain: 1 guy while ret of 400 people took cse
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Bijo John: True that
22/10/2021, 19:12 - Purvam Jain: Minority bijo and we believe in majority
22/10/2021, 19:13 - Shivanshu Shekhar: <Media omitted>
22/10/2021, 19:13 - Bijo John: But the point is, not everyone believes in money, so it's important to put other factors in perspective as well
22/10/2021, 19:13 - Purvam Jain: .🙂
22/10/2021, 19:13 - Bijo John: Though most peeps would ignore these other factors
22/10/2021, 19:13 - Shrey Shah: I know AIR 22 who took aero
22/10/2021, 19:14 - Shivanshu Shekhar: In bits one guy who was in cse got 9.5+ cg and changed his branch to chemical🙂
22/10/2021, 19:14 - Bijo John: That doesn't mean you have to influence an individual's decision, this matters when a collective decision has to be taken
22/10/2021, 19:14 - Bijo John: CHEMICAL?
22/10/2021, 19:14 - Bijo John: Wtf
22/10/2021, 19:14 - Rama Manoj: Lmao

22/10/2021, 19:15 - Purvam Jain: Maybe he wanted to make a new drug
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Bijo John: Not really
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Shivanshu Shekhar: I say he did this to look cool
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Saurav Kale: World is driven by what is mainstream. People take CS becauze that's what is most talked about. Tech companies are talked about. I'm sure no one talks about Qualcomm or Nvidia or Texas the same way ppl talk about Google and Microsoft even if they hold phones with Qualcomm chips in them, almost every electronic appliance they use has Texas boards in them... And every game they play is pretty much thanks to Nvidia.
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Purvam Jain: Exactly
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Rama Manoj: F
22/10/2021, 19:15 - Shivanshu Shekhar: Even in his profile he has written this that he did this

22/10/2021, 19:17 - Soham Roy: well wrt the best companies, from the people i have talked to, yes
22/10/2021, 19:17 - Bijo John: Go do comporg as well, be the digital gawd

22/10/2021, 19:18 - Raunak P: if ee doesnt get jobs
22/10/2021, 19:18 - Bijo John: If the best means Google, prolly yes. If you're good with Microsoft, fret not
22/10/2021, 19:18 - Rama Manoj: Maybe I will consider, 2016 is nice except for the prof
22/10/2021, 19:18 - Raunak P: then all the other branches are selling tea
22/10/2021, 19:18 - Rama Manoj: Soham can seduce a computer and make it beg for his babies

Do what makes you happy in the moment, with a vague idea of where you are going. That's all there is. Unless youre crazy, you'll end up alright.

22/10/2021, 19:41 - Soham Roy: tomp comder
22/10/2021, 19:41 - Rama Manoj: Definitely seem more available, and you are top notch so light
22/10/2021, 19:41 - Bijo John: Idk man, I see way too many tech roles
22/10/2021, 19:41 - Ruban EE19: That's not the issue. Most on campus opportunities are based on coding, analytics, finance, and other non core jobs
22/10/2021, 19:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: Man, were all of us like this too an year back?
22/10/2021, 19:41 - Ishaan Agarwal: Like wtf

22/10/2021, 19:42 - Raunak P: then you will be a wreck
22/10/2021, 19:42 - Ruban EE19: To pursue a career in actual core field, it's virtually become like highers is the only option
22/10/2021, 19:42 - Rama Manoj: I wanted to finish btech and chill doing a core job till I end up a old frick, I don't want to pursue further edu🥲😭
22/10/2021, 19:42 - Ruban EE19: That's how miserable our core fields employment opportunities are in IITM atleast
22/10/2021, 19:43 - Rama Manoj: Ah yes
22/10/2021, 19:43 - Ruban EE19: I'm saying this based on the internship companies. Not sure about placements tho

22/10/2021, 19:47 - Raunak P: go out in style
22/10/2021, 19:48 - Saurav Kale: I see it like this:
Are you not interested in EE? Good. Go thru btech and get out because you'll get opportunities in almost every other field including CS. Pick what you like, go thru btech and get out.


You're into EE? DD and further education will help you anyway. There are more demand for DD and higher in terms of core placements. Btech is also there... But core field demands more experience. You like EE anyway. So is it really a bad thing?
22/10/2021, 19:48 - Raunak P: or ill play it
22/10/2021, 19:48 - Rama Manoj: I fear having to pursue further studies for a job, and he is acting like Im the only dude studying here
22/10/2021, 19:48 - Arjun R: Be proud of yourself(not that u did not get placed) , be confident man

22/10/2021, 19:49 - Saurav Kale: Defo that's a thing many ppl go for too
22/10/2021, 19:49 - +91 98419 27079: Dd is for ppl who still wanna get internships/placements, mtech opens up opportunities elsewhere
22/10/2021, 19:49 - Rama Manoj: 😂😂😂
22/10/2021, 19:49 - Rama Manoj: Jomk
22/10/2021, 19:49 - Ruthika: PoSH
22/10/2021, 19:49 - Bijo John: You have the IITM tag when you're sitting for placements
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Bijo John: If you do mtech elsewhere, the tag is weakened
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Jayanth B: Directly out of college people do Mtech?
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Saurav Kale: Wow 😂😂😂😂
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Raunak P: bro youre lagging behind by a few hours in real life
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Jayanth B: I see
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Saurav Kale: MS.
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Arjun R: Was waiting for this, where were u? 🧐
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Jayanth B: Srsly?
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Ruban EE19: So I have a question for you guys. Be honest. Did you all take Elec for any of the following reasons:

1. Actual interest in the contents being taught and already had an idea about it (worked with circuits before)

2. Liked physics and particularly electronics in high school so chose elec

3. Liked CS a lot and since some senior told elec also has a lot of overlap with CS, took it. (not to mention most CS companies are open for elec as well)

4. Didn't give a sh*t about the branch. College tag is all that matters.

If you chose elec for any other reason, pls mention it as well
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Bijo John: If you do mtech, the jee tompr vibe is weakened
22/10/2021, 19:50 - Rama Manoj: 4
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Raunak P: a mix of all
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Ishaan Agarwal: 4. Followed the "branch order" JEE students worship and picked IITM.
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Rushill Bairavan: Offered the most opportunities
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Raunak P: except 3
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Ruban EE19: So how do you feel about your decision now? Is elec really appealing to you or you're just going with the flow?
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Soham Roy: 3 and slight 1
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Jayanth B: ++
22/10/2021, 19:51 - Ruthika: Home

22/10/2021, 19:51 - Manomukil T: Have influenced people to put this much mokka?
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Ishaan Agarwal: 2 and 4 contradict each other?
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Rama Manoj: Going with the flow, I have a weird handicap of failing to study anything beyond course material , so this is what I enjoy the most rn. No choice other than that.
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Bijo John: 4 and slight lower 2
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Keerthana Rachuri: Better option after cs, took unwillingly only
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Ruban EE19: Haan I missed this reason-"Financial struggles. So chose elec so that I can crack the palcements and pay back my family loans"
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Ruthika: We missed you 🥲
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Arjun R: That's why 🤌; tag was kinda impt🙂
22/10/2021, 19:52 - Rama Manoj: I kinda enjoy physics though, atleast more than math

22/10/2021, 20:09 - Saurav Kale: I explored Arduino a lot before JEE times... Raspberry Pi I tried but Linux was too much for me at the time... Loved arduino stuffs... Understood very little tho. I encountered the word flip flop and lowpass filter in one of my projects in 10th and I gave up on it after that lol
22/10/2021, 20:09 - Ruban EE19: Seems like you got the perfect branch and happily enjoying the courses

23/10/2021, 11:04 - Bijo John: The difference is that there are a lot more people writing, so way easier to get good grades
23/10/2021, 11:04 - Manomukil T: It has both sides.... if the exams are low scoring u still have chance of an S na
23/10/2021, 11:04 - Bijo John: And maybe the specific percentiles may be different

23/10/2021, 11:07 - Bijo John: See they stand a chance of getting 8 where they deserve 9, they also stand a chance of getting 10 where they deserve 9 na.... overall we can assume it cancels out
23/10/2021, 11:08 - Rushill Bairavan: Yep
23/10/2021, 11:08 - Bijo John: But still weird only
23/10/2021, 11:08 - Shivanshu Shekhar: My friend said that many profs give 10

25/10/2021, 09:43 - Raunak P: its good for visuals
25/10/2021, 09:43 - Raunak P: not veru intuitibe
25/10/2021, 09:43 - Raunak P: intuitive*
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: and it looks like its been designed for a tablet more than a pc
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: and its got several cups i think
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: from what ive heard
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Chinmaya: As expected
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: so performance of 10 is better than 11 for now
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Chinmaya: Windows 7 was best
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: and tbh 10 is also visually stunning only
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Ayush Jamdar: ++
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Chinmaya: Good ol times
25/10/2021, 09:44 - Raunak P: unless you are like a pure designer
25/10/2021, 09:45 - Chinmaya: .

25/10/2021, 09:45 - Raunak P: then go ahead and upgrade
25/10/2021, 09:45 - Raunak P: otherwise dont
25/10/2021, 09:45 - +91 98419 27079: More clicks needed to do the same thing, can't say the difference apart from that. Also WA desktop application isn't working
25/10/2021, 09:45 - Raunak P: but heres the thing, it may become better later, but free update will be gone ig
25/10/2021, 09:46 - +91 79950 11126: WA desktop is working for me
25/10/2021, 09:46 - Purvam Jain: Eh isnt there like 1 year period?
25/10/2021, 09:47 - +91 79950 11126: Upgrade if you want to run android apps without using BlueStacks or other exes
25/10/2021, 09:47 - Raunak P: not sure
25/10/2021, 09:47 - +91 79950 11126: And if you are fan of round corners
25/10/2021, 09:48 - +91 98419 27079: Oo 👀 fault is on my end ig
25/10/2021, 09:48 - Purvam Jain: Ok👌🏻
25/10/2021, 09:48 - Raunak P: but it isnt as smooth as 10 or smth no
25/10/2021, 09:48 - +91 79950 11126: WebEx also updated to round corners
25/10/2021, 09:48 - Raunak P: i keep hearing negative reviews
25/10/2021, 09:49 - Purvam Jain: U ll have to upgrade later
25/10/2021, 09:49 - +91 79950 11126: It's keeps on sending reports of performance to Microsoft so background run of system is more
25/10/2021, 09:49 - Purvam Jain: Once security patches stop
25/10/2021, 09:49 - Raunak P: that performance isnt as good as 10
25/10/2021, 09:50 - +91 79950 11126: And for smooth work you have to wait for 2-3min after power on
25/10/2021, 09:50 - Raunak P: idk what exactly they mean by performace tho
25/10/2021, 09:50 - +91 79950 11126: Then it works good
25/10/2021, 09:50 - Raunak P: hdd or ssd?
25/10/2021, 09:50 - +91 79950 11126: Hdd🥲

25/10/2021, 10:01 - Saurav Kale: It's good. But kinda different
25/10/2021, 10:01 - Saurav Kale: Takes some getting used to
25/10/2021, 10:01 - Srichandra: I ignored

25/10/2021, 10:01 - Saurav Kale: Might be annoying for some
25/10/2021, 10:02 - Nipun EE: this is what im scared of lmao
25/10/2021, 10:02 - Manomukil T: It will take atleast another 5 years
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Purvam Jain: But can u still upgrade till then? Like till when can we upgrade for free?
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Purvam Jain: 👌🏻
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Srichandra: I didn't even know there would a free time period
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Srichandra: Thought we can install anytime
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Manomukil T: Around a year more is my guess
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Saurav Kale: It's good only tbh
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Purvam Jain: Guesstimate 🙏🏻
25/10/2021, 10:04 - Saurav Kale: I kinda recommend updating
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Manomukil T: Or if it becomes stable ... whichever happens earlier
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Saurav Kale: Unless you have some win10 critical shiz
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Saurav Kale: It doesn't fuck up your Linux dual boot so don't worry
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Saurav Kale: Only thing that changes is boot order
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Saurav Kale: You'll have to go back into bios and change it to Linux firdt.
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Saurav Kale: Rest all same as ever
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Raunak P: does it affect like
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Rushill Bairavan: I don't think this will happen. Even win 10 can be easily activated for free. Msft dosent care
25/10/2021, 10:05 - Purvam Jain: Ah will it login to windows automatically.
25/10/2021, 10:06 - Raunak P: performance for heavy softwares / games
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Saurav Kale: Not much afaik. I've played some games, done some video editing. No noticeable difference for me
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Manomukil T: Apart from appearance what r the pros?
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Saurav Kale: But I've heard on tech forums that it throttles performance
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Saurav Kale: Nothing.
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Saurav Kale: It just looks sexier that's all
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Saurav Kale: Literally nothing else has changed
25/10/2021, 10:07 - Manomukil T: Then lite
25/10/2021, 10:08 - Raunak P: sure about no change in performance?
25/10/2021, 10:09 - Saurav Kale: That's the only thing I can't be sure of
25/10/2021, 10:09 - Saurav Kale: .

26/10/2021, 14:11 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: The vacant seats reserved for SC, ST and PwD candidates will be allotted to the candidates of respective categories for admission to a preparatory course of one-year duration on the basis of relaxed admission criteria (seeRank Lists).



Admission is given to the candidates in the preparatory course provided (i) the seats reserved for the respective category are vacant, (ii) candidates have not accepted a seat in the preparatory course earlier.



All the IITs will run preparatory courses of one year duration for SC, ST and PwD candidates intended to prepare them to pursue the academic program (for session 2017-18) to which they have been allocated. At the end of this course, candidates are declared as pass or fail.



On successful completion of the course, the candidates will be offered direct admission in July 2018 (Academic Year 2018-19) to the already allotted undergraduate course.



Candidates admitted to the preparatory course are also eligible to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2018 subject to fulfilling other eligibility criteria.



Filling-in of choices for preparatory courses is through the same online portal.

28/10/2021, 11:51 - Antonson J: Where r u
28/10/2021, 11:51 - Aneesh Kandi: IDDD Datascience is different na. In newer depts like AI let's say, Idt the curriculum is that different from CS. Since it's new. So companies can be same. And anyway the demand for them is still high even though new
28/10/2021, 11:51 - Raunak P: Others are stuck doing smth random

28/10/2021, 12:02 - Rama Manoj: But the games you can throw in two pokemon from the same egg group or a pokemon and a ditto in a day care and get these eggs
28/10/2021, 12:03 - Rama Manoj: And chansey(or its Evo blissey) have a baby pokemon happiny in their line
28/10/2021, 12:03 - Rama Manoj: So we can assume their eggs if allowed to hatch will hatch into happiny's

Especially for ppl who are trying to skip elec courses and who are trying to go into non-core, this 3 credits can make a difference later by letting you take maybe a 9 credit course instead of a 12 credit one.... Just saying ....
28/10/2021, 21:13 - Antonson J: And this is the only possible 6th course which you can do in sem-4 I suppose. Assuming no slot change. So...
28/10/2021, 21:13 - Rushill Bairavan: Where can I find more about this course?
28/10/2021, 21:14 - Antonson J: Academic website
28/10/2021, 21:14 - Antonson J: Or check smail
28/10/2021, 21:27 - +91 98419 27079: Best eg is do this and a BTP to get rid of the core curriculum requirement
28/10/2021, 21:27 - Aniruddha EE: whats this seminar course about?
28/10/2021, 21:34 - Raunak P: i took up a 12 credit hs course instead of the general 9 credit this sem
28/10/2021, 21:35 - Raunak P: so like does it balance out or smth?
28/10/2021, 21:36 - Aniruddha EE: no. u still need 6 more hs credits, which means u will have to do another 9 cred hs course in sem7.
28/10/2021, 21:37 - Raunak P: Bruh
28/10/2021, 21:37 - Raunak P: That we all have to do anyway
28/10/2021, 21:37 - Raunak P: I'm saying
28/10/2021, 21:37 - Raunak P: Suppose I don't take this
28/10/2021, 21:37 - Raunak P: Do I still get the option of taking up a 9 credit course instead of 12
28/10/2021, 21:38 - Aniruddha EE: that is for the core credit requirement na. your extra 3 creds are hs creds, not core elec.
28/10/2021, 21:39 - Raunak P: Ohh F
28/10/2021, 21:39 - Raunak P: Leave anyway I can sit and give lecs on importance of ppl and all

29/10/2021, 22:20 - Saurav Kale: i liked making things. If math helped in that regard, fine. Math and programming to me in general has been a tool. Like any other tool. I would never love doing math just for the sake of learning math. If it teaches me something about the real world, then I love it. But i cant study pure theory in anything just for the sake of it. It must directly or indirectly relate to the real world and help me make or understand something.

31/10/2021, 20:06 - +91 75590 68027: 🥲
31/10/2021, 20:06 - Mohith Mvs: It's so difficult to bat bro
31/10/2021, 20:06 - Mohith Mvs: 😞
31/10/2021, 20:06 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Whyy

31/10/2021, 20:07 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: I don't want to see India losing this and win with namibia later
31/10/2021, 20:07 - Harisankar K J: But this is too bad of a performance considering they are very good players
31/10/2021, 20:07 - Saurav Kale: our bowling is good, but they can apply pressure only when the total is defendable... if the batting collapses, bowling can't win it alone.
31/10/2021, 20:08 - Shrey Shah: I hate this shit
31/10/2021, 20:08 - Shrey Shah: FML
31/10/2021, 20:08 - Saurav Kale: like i mean... india with this XI can't win purely by bowling better
31/10/2021, 20:08 - +91 75590 68027: Bowling can't save today anyway , dew is there so
31/10/2021, 20:08 - Mohith Mvs: Yeah

31/10/2021, 20:09 - Mohith Mvs: 😞
31/10/2021, 20:09 - Shrey Shah: I mean that
31/10/2021, 20:09 - Shrey Shah: But kohli is supposed to do this
31/10/2021, 20:10 - Shrey Shah: He is the only person who can handle the pressure rn imo
31/10/2021, 20:10 - +91 75590 68027: But how many times will we continue to rely on him
31/10/2021, 20:10 - +91 75590 68027: 🥲

31/10/2021, 20:11 - Mohith Mvs: Bro he alone can't get good score as he can't take risk playing big shots
31/10/2021, 20:11 - Mohith Mvs: 😔
31/10/2021, 20:11 - Shrey Shah: True, centuries put on a hold for so long anyway

Nz should lose atleast two out of their last 3 matches and one of them has to be against Afghan(but it shouldn't be a big victory otherwise it'll increase Afghans already humongous nrr.)
Namibia has to lose 2 of their 3 games.
Then India has to defeat Nam , Scotland and Afghan winning by 200 runs or within 10 overs in atleast 2 games , one of them preferably against Afgan.

```int f(int x, int y){
...
}

int g(int a, int (*f)(int, int){
...
}
```
I can use the function f inside g. What's the difference between this and a global declaration of f?

02/11/2021, 09:06 - Soham Roy: Whereas in global you'd be choosing a single function
02/11/2021, 09:07 - Bijo John: Okay, so it points to the memory address where the code for the function is stored and gives arguments?
02/11/2021, 09:07 - Soham Roy: But copilot is amaze, my friend had a test question of implement queue using 2 stacks,
I typed "class QueueUsingStacks" and it gave correct code
02/11/2021, 09:08 - Soham Roy: Yes
02/11/2021, 09:08 - Bijo John: So it searches all over github?

02/11/2021, 09:27 - Ishaan Agarwal: Yeah but some people question how ethical it is. Coz it was trained on open source data, and Microsoft is trying to monetize it now.
02/11/2021, 09:27 - Ayush Jamdar:

02/11/2021, 09:28 - Manomukil T: Ur an innocent kid so put peace beta
02/11/2021, 09:28 - Rushill Bairavan: Pretty sure Microsoft would have read the terms of the open source license 🙏
02/11/2021, 09:28 - Soham Roy: What if it ends up spewing ditto your code, but doesn't notify the programmer of whatever license you've applied to it
02/11/2021, 09:29 - Ayush Jamdar: <Media omitted>
02/11/2021, 09:29 - Manomukil T: Nope
02/11/2021, 09:29 - Soham Roy: Most open source licences are such that you have to mention the original license if you use it
02/11/2021, 09:29 - Rahul Desai: Does
Not having this mean my phone sucks?
02/11/2021, 09:29 - Manomukil T: Many don't
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Bijo John: That's in pc
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Rushill Bairavan: Copilot is trained on it, why would everything that uses copilot need to mention it?
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Ayush Jamdar: Keyboard things
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Soham Roy: As I said, copilot could ofor some specific case output nearly the same code
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Ayush Jamdar: Dwnld Greek pack
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Manomukil T: Most of the time they bail themselves out
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Manomukil T: And people forget that shit
02/11/2021, 09:30 - Rushill Bairavan: Then it's a problem
02/11/2021, 09:31 - Soham Roy: Also who does the code it write belong to?
02/11/2021, 09:31 - Soham Roy: If is uses open source data to provide solutions, am I allowed to pass it off as my own code?
02/11/2021, 09:31 - Rahul Desai: β
02/11/2021, 09:31 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
02/11/2021, 09:31 - Soham Roy: Etc
02/11/2021, 09:33 - Manomukil T: And also maybe a condition that the source of code is from a public repo?
02/11/2021, 09:33 - Soham Roy: But whatever the case, it just does e v e r y t h i n g
02/11/2021, 09:34 - Bijo John: It's not really sourced from a repo na, it uses ai to generate code ryt
02/11/2021, 09:34 - Manomukil T: What abt training set for the AI
02/11/2021, 09:34 - Soham Roy: Training set is open source code
02/11/2021, 09:35 - Manomukil T: From github itself or just every such possible code?
02/11/2021, 09:35 - Soham Roy: Best part is it gives multiple suggestion. So suppose you don't want to use function pointers, next recommendation would probably use an array or something
02/11/2021, 09:35 - Soham Roy: Github itself, but how does it matter?
02/11/2021, 09:36 - Manomukil T: I was just thinking abt the private and public repo and also a few of them have licenses ig
02/11/2021, 09:36 - Manomukil T: That is they cannot be used for any profitable venture
02/11/2021, 09:36 - Soham Roy: They only used public repos, and nearly all of them have licences
02/11/2021, 09:37 - Soham Roy: Usual license is that you can do anything as long as you mention author or can do anything as long as you use original license
02/11/2021, 09:38 - Rama Manoj: Does this mean mentioning that we used co pilot, and copilot mentioning it's training set is enough?
02/11/2021, 09:39 - Manomukil T: Yeahh so if we get code from repos with such licenses via this pilot... does it also give the author name and license?
02/11/2021, 09:39 - Manomukil T: If not its problematic ryt?
02/11/2021, 09:39 - Soham Roy: It doesn't give author names and required licence if any, which might be an issue
02/11/2021, 09:39 - Soham Roy: "GitHub code" isn't credit
02/11/2021, 09:40 - Rama Manoj: 😶
02/11/2021, 09:41 - Manomukil T: So yep... it does finally depend on what and all exactly they used in their training set
02/11/2021, 09:46 - Soham Roy: Yeah I mean if something requires basic accreditation to use and you use it for training a model, what can be done? This sort of thing has never been done on this scale for potential commercialisation I think

03/11/2021, 00:07 - Jayanth B: Hi, 
I am nameless and shameless.
My nickname is Abhiram Rao.
I am from Hyderabad.
My “factory” was Forum for Indian Institute of Technology and Joint Entrance Exam (FIITJEE) Hyderabad. 
My All India Rank in the Joint Entrance Examination(JEE) Advanced conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in the year TWO thousand ZERO hundred TWENTY(2020) is ZERO thousand FIVE hundred SIXTY FIVE(565).
I’ll be pursuing a Bachelors of Technology in the department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
My hobbies include playing and (watching a lot of) cricket, browsing on reddit and youtube (for meme content, travel/food vlogs, debunking mysteries, general trivia). I listen to a lot of music in my free time. Like to explore new places as well(but then Corona🙃).
I love watching science fiction/thriller (huge Nolan fan) movies as well. Been looking out for some nice web series after the exams. I am a foodie as well. 
Looking forward to meeting you all at the Institute and making some nice memories. Excited for this new phase of life. Cheers!

03/11/2021, 10:42 - Raunak P: He did a crime to Ruth
03/11/2021, 10:42 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Debate on fair grounds means to put forward their points strongly, not make others situation compromisable

03/11/2021, 10:43 - Ruthika: If we don't go to insti now we'll face problems like our seniors did and if they don't let ee19 batch now they'd only have to go to insti to complete all the pending labs

03/11/2021, 10:52 - Aneesh Kandi: Well one thing is that our online classes are better than theirs tbh. More systematic. But don't kill me
03/11/2021, 10:52 - Bijo John: The action may be trivial but the intent is not
03/11/2021, 10:53 - Ruthika: He didn't directly asked them to consider ee19 alright
03/11/2021, 10:53 - Raunak P: someone has definitely fucked bijo over in the past
03/11/2021, 10:53 - Bijo John: Abhigyan very much did

03/11/2021, 10:54 - Jayanth B: What Bijo is saying is that the seniors should have just given a heads up.
03/11/2021, 10:54 - Bijo John: Exactly
03/11/2021, 10:54 - Rushill Bairavan: Ay, don't do this. You're hurting yourself

Poor soul
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Manomukil T: Yes I understand some facts were wrong in that mail but I'm pretty sure that was by accident.. and yes everyone is desperate to go back to insti
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Bijo John: What else did abhigyan say?
"Surely the 20b batch can wait for a sem?"
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Ruthika: 😂😂
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Rushill Bairavan: Both are the same thing
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Chinmaya: Ok don't blame anto for that
03/11/2021, 10:59 - Jayanth B: It's not just about taking it seriously. The final decision lies in the hands of the admin. But most of us know these seniors well, and obviously we want to go to insti together. At least I want to. So maybe we kinda expected something and got something else instead
03/11/2021, 11:00 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: No man, they said we can wait for 1 sem
03/11/2021, 11:00 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: That's not good
03/11/2021, 11:00 - Nikhil S: I understand your point but I think if we stay one more semester at home and then by the end of that not know when they may call us we may also try to do things like this..
03/11/2021, 11:00 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: If that lime wasn't there, then all fine
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Chinmaya: It's fine let's wait. If it's that important for them to be there before us
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Jayanth B: True. They had their important sems and labs wiped away. Can't blame them either
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Hmmm _ahem_ahem_
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Jayanth B: Oh well
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Manomukil T: Imo the only thing we can blame is this pandemic
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Perhaps 2018 peeps can say how their labs anol were done in 3rd year
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Ofc ofc ofc ofc
03/11/2021, 11:01 - Jayanth B: Some labs got cancelled
03/11/2021, 11:02 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Ohh chit
03/11/2021, 11:02 - Ruthika: And we'll get an online 4th sem ✨🙂
03/11/2021, 11:02 - Chinmaya: Say lol and move on
03/11/2021, 11:03 - Bijo John: See, I don't blame them for doing it. What I blame them for is acting totally cool and like it's the perfect thing to do
03/11/2021, 11:03 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: They missed a lot, They are gonna do them next sem anyways. 18 batch will be called fs, So there is less chance that 19 and 20 both are called at once.
03/11/2021, 11:03 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Hmm okiee daa, but ig 5th sem in campus won't be fun
03/11/2021, 11:03 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Interns anol
03/11/2021, 11:04 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: 18 are in campus
03/11/2021, 11:04 - Bijo John: Seriously, we treated every senior of ours like a good friend or role model, and this is what we get. They don't have any remorse also
03/11/2021, 11:04 - +91 99513 67352: That’s the main disadvantage seniors experienced during internships
03/11/2021, 11:04 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Ryt??
03/11/2021, 11:04 - Bijo John: That's what's pissing me off
03/11/2021, 11:04 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Nope, Not all

03/11/2021, 11:34 - Aniruddha EE: tbh, i agree about 2nd year. but in 1st year, we literally had no reason to be in campus other than some lite labs.
03/11/2021, 11:34 - Ruban EE19: No no
03/11/2021, 11:34 - Ruban EE19: I'm just telling this. Could be helpful for you in future as well na 😅😅

03/11/2021, 11:36 - Aniruddha EE: Exactly
03/11/2021, 11:36 - Srichandra: You were telling 4th year is not chill and you can't do pending labs then 🙂
03/11/2021, 11:36 - Ruban EE19: I don't get you
03/11/2021, 11:37 - Ruban EE19: When did I say 4th year is not chill?
03/11/2021, 11:37 - Ruban EE19: I told it for 4th sem
03/11/2021, 11:37 - Chinmaya: Also 3rd years annoyed admins saying profs didnt respond to mails and all

03/11/2021, 11:37 - Nikhil S: i agree but ,personally I spent all of my 12th standard ,restricting myself a lot and just imagining how great life in IIT would be and I knew then that first year is chill and second year core courses start and wanted to enjoy first year for all the things I went through for four years in school and making that online and making us sit at home just made life as unfair as it can be

03/11/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: You will be picking most of the courses
03/11/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: So whether it'll be chill or not depends on you
03/11/2021, 11:38 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Group name super 👌🏽😁
03/11/2021, 11:38 - Ruban EE19: It depend son whether you got a ppo or not, depends on whether you wanna do dual or not
03/11/2021, 11:39 - Srichandra: Hmm okk, but it'll be generally to complete the remaining credits na?
03/11/2021, 11:39 - Ruban EE19: But 2nd and 3rd years are stuffed up with core courses which must be compulsorily done. They'll give you an idea about different profiels

03/11/2021, 12:04 - Rama Manoj: I just feel like my "life" ended after 9th, just work from there onwards, will be work ahead of it.
03/11/2021, 12:04 - Nikhil S: It wont be a suffering if you actually like ee.. yes workload will be huge but we can at least do that with our friends around .. more peer pressure more motivation to work ..
03/11/2021, 12:05 - Rama Manoj: Liking ee is a matter of luck though, and peer pressure can be good or bad
03/11/2021, 12:09 - Nikhil S: well its in your hands on how you take the peer pressure.. look at others work and we should be like "ok we should also work" not like "this is too much pressure I cant handle it " I mean if you can cross the jee pressure where everyone had only one goal.. i am pretty sure in college it will be easier as ppl have different interests and competition in your field of interest will be lesser.
03/11/2021, 12:09 - Antonson J:

03/11/2021, 13:43 - Saurav Kale: Bro I literally had no idea that the EE20 batch had no digital systems labs, someone told me that they were having some of those.
And the intention here isn't that the batch of 20 shouldn't go first, the thing is we have missed out on the internships due to having really bad labs and courses thanks to the administration not putting proper thought into the course or lab framework.
I am truly sorry for making things sound that way. We're all in a shitty position, and the administration isn't providing us any clear details.

I feel the only recourse for us is to actually unite instead of fighting among ourselves. The admin is in fact instigating such fights among us by keeping us in the dark and making us feel like there's an impostor among us when in reality it's them keeping us all away and trying to make us fight like this.

IIT Bombay was able to reopen with 50% capacity, anyone who wished to return was allowed to, provided there was enough room to accommodate them. Why are we still in a situation like this?

Moreover, the main intention of those mails was to get some concrete information on the details. They gave 0 facts, 0 dates, and gave vague replies as they have been giving all the time. The only reply we managed to get was that they've planned a Workshop for the EE20 batch, which is great for them, but still no information for us.

Finally, I'm sorry to the EE20 peeps again, they're literally our own people, and I've ended up turning them against me... Wasn't the intention at all

05/11/2021, 21:02 - +91 79896 22077: He s competing with ponting and Graeme Smith 😂
05/11/2021, 21:02 - Raunak P: See I don't follow cricket, but I'm for sure that mr captain cool s captaincy is better

05/11/2021, 21:08 - +91 75590 68027: Well if you're talking about numbers,  Kohli has better win percentage(70 and 65)as captain than Dhoni(59,59) in both Odis and T20is .
But I understand,  Dhoni is more of a "captain" and Kohli is more of a "batsman" and he def has the record of ICC trophies , but that doesn't mean Kohli is some gully captain
05/11/2021, 21:09 - Manomukil T: It also depends on the total no of games too
05/11/2021, 21:11 - +91 75590 68027: Yeah okay , but I'm not wrong I saying "maybe" as good as Dhoni noe
05/11/2021, 21:11 - +91 79896 22077: ++
05/11/2021, 21:11 - +91 75590 68027: It's not like there is a huge difference
05/11/2021, 21:12 - +91 79896 22077: Dhoni brought cups (icc and ipl) , kohli didn't
05/11/2021, 21:13 - +91 75590 68027: Yeah on the other hand , Kohli made us a better test side( 5 times Test Mace in a row.) , changed our attitude towards the game ..especially against teams like Aus etc.
Both have their own contributions  but I feel Kohli is severely mistreated when it comes to captaincy
05/11/2021, 21:14 - +91 79896 22077: I completely agree with you

06/11/2021, 18:01 - Purvam Jain: Greetings from Analytics Club, Centre For Innovation (CFI), IIT Madras!

Many leaders in the Data Science community say that an essential part of being a Data Science Practitioner involves being able to architect pipelines for a given problem statement. What they don't tell you is that most of these pipelines stem from one base reference code that you build at some stage in your learning. 

Ever wondered how Big Businesses Forecast their sales? Or maybe try to predict times when they need to stock up on their inventory? In order to help you build this reference code for most data science pipelines and develop your thought process we bring to you a session where we walk you through building this reference code for the Predict Future Sales problem on Kaggle. Here is an opportunity for you to explore the problem, learn the different ways to approach it and to get yourself your base reference code for building complete pipelines.

There are no prerequisites for attending the session except enthusiasm to learn. Although, we recommend you go over the problem statement once before the session so that you guys know what to expect. 

Date: 6th November 2021
Time: 6pm - 8pm

Meet Link: https://meet.google.com/buc-fkzu-aee

Looking forward to having you onboard for the Session!!

Thanks and Regards,

06/11/2021, 21:08 - Rahul Desai: I used to do such bs as a kid tbh 
I used to make a cardboard plane and in place of propellers we used to put flower pots 
It used to fly 
But not so far 
It barely crossed the street but it was cool af 
And we out chilli bombs in it and when it burns completely it used to boom!!
06/11/2021, 21:08 - Rahul Desai: 🌝
06/11/2021, 21:09 - Arjun R: I lit the end of a paper plane and threw🥲, sadly it didnt work
06/11/2021, 21:10 - Saurav Kale: The fire probably doesn't allow the slight vaccum to form underneath the plane. Hence it has no lift.
06/11/2021, 21:11 - Saurav Kale: I doubt unless you directed the fire through a nozzle that it would even fly.
06/11/2021, 21:11 - Raunak P: now we are on a rift
06/11/2021, 21:11 - Bijo John: Lol every kid thinks rockets fly coz of the fire

06/11/2021, 21:28 - Purvam Jain: Idr
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Srichandra: Ver few episodes
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Purvam Jain: But it was ok
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: In that in one episode burpy will become like one flying chakra thing and burn up everyone na
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: I used to recreate it with bhuchakra
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: Like
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: Hold it
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: Light it
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Purvam Jain: Chakra is naruto
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: And frisbee go weeee

06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: Like
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: A flame circle
06/11/2021, 21:28 - Rahul Desai: And we used to put race with that 
Like whose goes furthest
06/11/2021, 21:29 - Saurav Kale: I wanna tie a rocket horizontally to a post with some rope and set it off.
06/11/2021, 21:29 - Saurav Kale: It'll make a nice fire spiral hopefully 🙂
06/11/2021, 21:29 - Purvam Jain: Be part of my Team Rocket
06/11/2021, 21:29 - Purvam Jain: 🥰
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Ayush Jamdar: A faulty rope and a neighbour's kicc
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Saurav Kale: Well do it on a ground na
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Saurav Kale: Or use thin steel cable so the rope doesn't burn off
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Rahul Desai: I'll tell one better
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Rahul Desai: Put flowerpot behind rc car
06/11/2021, 21:30 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Rahul Desai: Stick it to it
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Ayush Jamdar: Nice send vid after doing it
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Saurav Kale: I don't have rockets left. Finished off all of em on diwali itself
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Snehitha Andapally: Read it as bichandra lol
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Purvam Jain: Rahul have u ever tried sticking flowerpot on bhuch and lighting them together?
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Ayush Jamdar: Bhuichakkar
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Purvam Jain: I always wanted to see this
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Rahul Desai: Yee
06/11/2021, 21:31 - Srichandra: There are actually many YouTube channels doing all kinds of dumb things with fireworks like we are telling 😂
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Purvam Jain: Do it record it upload it
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Purvam Jain: Hmm
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Rahul Desai: I don't burst crackers anymore
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Purvam Jain: 🤣
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Purvam Jain: Ur brother does na
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Rahul Desai: 😂😂
06/11/2021, 21:32 - Purvam Jain: Just do this
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Rahul Desai: No 
Noone in my family bursts crackers anymore 
Atleast at home 
Coz lucky
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Saurav Kale: I tried to get two bhuichakkars to fight it out in one of those Big cement mixing bowl things. But usually one of them will create enough smoke and fumes to choke the other. The other just stops burning.
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Rahul Desai: It won't be fun to watch tho
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Like Beyblades?
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Saurav Kale: I feel next time a perforated surface should be there. That should keep enough oxygen going for both to sustain the sparks
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Saurav Kale: Ya
06/11/2021, 21:33 - Saurav Kale: It doesn't work.
06/11/2021, 21:34 - Rahul Desai: Noob 
Our bhuchakra fights were better 
Like 2 ppl light at same time 
And you have to stop it manually (without fire going off) first one to do that wins
06/11/2021, 21:34 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: instead send it horizontally na
06/11/2021, 21:34 - Aditya Nanda Kishore: Like a bullet
06/11/2021, 21:34 - Saurav Kale: Too dangerous
06/11/2021, 21:35 - Rahul Desai: It won't go 🥴 
Well expensive ones do
06/11/2021, 21:35 - Saurav Kale: And besides it won't create the beautiful spiral pattern
06/11/2021, 21:35 - Rahul Desai: But idts it's worth it
06/11/2021, 21:35 - Saurav Kale: Let's see. I've got a year to create this surface 😂
06/11/2021, 21:35 - Rahul Desai: I once tried putting flowerpot as rocket
06/11/2021, 21:36 - Saurav Kale: I want two bhuichakkars to crash like beyblades. 🥲
06/11/2021, 21:36 - Rahul Desai: ++
06/11/2021, 21:36 - Rahul Desai: You can do that manually tho
06/11/2021, 21:36 - Rahul Desai: Like kicking yours at the other one
06/11/2021, 21:36 - Saurav Kale: Eh see if you find a way like either by chance or by force then what's the fun 😤
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Saurav Kale: I want em to be in a hemispherical stadium and realistically crash 😤
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Srichandra: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Saurav Kale: I feel a sufficiently big stadium would do.
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:37 - Saurav Kale: But if I wanna do it on a small one then I'd need some way to keep the oxygen going so one doesnt choke.
06/11/2021, 21:38 - Rahul Desai: My favourite are rockets tho 
But rest of stuff is more fun as u can do whatever u want with it
06/11/2021, 21:38 - Saurav Kale: Hmm true
06/11/2021, 21:38 - Snehitha Andapally: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:38 - Srichandra: Did it even take off lol?
06/11/2021, 21:38 - Saurav Kale: 😂
06/11/2021, 21:39 - Rahul Desai: No 
It'll just fall down and go crazy 🥴

06/11/2021, 21:42 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
06/11/2021, 21:42 - Saurav Kale: Now that you can actually estimate or explain why it won't work. What a powerful feeling 🙂

06/11/2021, 21:53 - Saurav Kale: But ya... I'd rather explore 2-3 things than put a lot of time in one like Raftar. So I solved the application, gave interview but I didn't take 🥲

08/11/2021, 12:53 - Ishaan Agarwal: Attn: General. The guidelines are similar to midsem. There are some changes from the midsem, which are highlighted in bold. Please familiarise yourself with the rules, to avoid losing marks due to your negligence. Note: Should there be significant technical glitches that prevent somebody from taking the exam on Teams+SAFE as mentioned in the guidelines and document below, they may make a request for reexam with appropriate justification and proofs to me (instructor) and the Head of the Dept. If (and only if) the request and justification are deemed genuine AND reasonable, you will be awarded II grade and ask to take reexam i.e. not taking endsem exam using the SAFE+Teams mode does not automatically qualify you for re-exam/partial credit etc. EE224 end-semester exam guidelines Exam date and time: Wednesday November 10th 2021; 8.30am-12.30pm Mode of operation: SAFE + MS Teams We shall be conducting the endsem exam for this course via the SAFE app in the assigned slot. We shall proctor the exam via video on MS Teams. Before the exam: We will use the same course in SAFE that was used for midsem. Make sure that you download the quiz (i.e. endsem question paper) before exam. The quiz will be published one day before the exam. You will be added to a private Teams channel for proctoring by the instructor. Please ensure you have TWO devices. A Primary device (mobile) with the SAFE app installed, and a secondary device (PC/Laptop/Mobile) with a webcam for video proctoring. Ensure that you have a software/browser plugin that can record screen on secondary device without crashing. Exam will be open-notes. You may refer to your notebook (hard copy only; NO digital notes) in the exam. On day of the exam: You will attempt the exam on sheets of paper or notebook i.e. handwritten. Each sheet/page must have your name, roll number, date and signature. Please ensure that you have prepared adequate number of pages in advance of starting the exam. You will attempt the quiz on the mobile device (primary device) with SAFE app, and we shall monitor you via video. Password for accessing the question paper will be shared by the proctors at 9am on day of the exam, in the Teams meeting for each private channel. Do not attend to any calls on the primary device, we will find out via the SAFE interface. If you get a call, reject it. Please make sure your mobile device has sufficient battery life for attempting this exam. No headphones/earphones for connecting to the primary device. Via the secondary device, preferable connect speakers so you can listen to audio announcements by the proctors. If you do not have speakers with the secondary device, you can use a headphone/earphone connected to the secondary device for listening to the proctors. You must place the secondary device (i.e. laptop) on which you have joined the Teams meeting, at a distance of at least 3ft from you. Those who are found to be sitting closer to their laptop will lose 10 marks (out of max. 40 possible) for not complying with rules. Proctors will take screenshot and alert the instructor. You will find out if you lost 10 marks when grades are released. Your work area must be visible in the field of view of your video. Proctors may ask to see your work sheet and work area if they have suspicions about honor code violation. Those who do not comply with proctor instructions will be held in contempt of honor code. In midsem exam, several students were using Teams chat or talking with their proctors with mic ON after exam had started. Such incidents will not be allowed in endsem. Those found to use chat or communicate using mic will lose 10 marks in endsem. Your video must be always ON. In midsem exam, we excused students whose video turned off. In endsem exam, we will deduct 5 marks for those who are found to have video OFF at any time during the exam. Please ensure that you join the right channel in Teams meeting on secondary device. You are requested in advance to "turn the incoming video off" so that nobody faces a bandwidth issue. Your video must remain ON throughout the exam. Use a screen recording software/browser plugin to record video on the secondary device during the exam. You will not be asked to submit this video; it will be needed should there be any internet/power outage/suspicion of malpractice. In the video, your hands and desk MUST BE VISIBLE at all times. You should not talk/look at the secondary device (on which you have joined the MS Teams meeting) during the exam. The proctors can request to see the mobile device at any time. Do not open any other app on the mobile. Please avoid indulging in any activity that causes suspicion. Please be informed that the SAFE app registers any attempts to move from the "quiz" to other applications. Please also be informed that any calls made or ongoing calls are registered on the application and the details are available with the instructor. We request you to be very honest while attempting this exam, in accordance with the honour code. Violation of honour code will result in `FR’ grade. Thank you for your cooperation. If you are done early with your exam, you may submit your work on SAFE, HOWEVER YOU SHOULD STAY SIGNED IN TO THE TEAMS MEETING UNTIL YOUR PROCTOR ASKS YOU TO LEAVE OR UNTIL THE MEETING IS CLOSED. You should not chat or talk with your proctor (10 marks will be deducted if you do). BONUS QUESTION(S): The exam may have bonus question(s). Max. possible marks = 40. Any marks scored in bonus questions will be counted in your total, however max. marks will be capped at 40. Submitting your work: You will attempt the exam on sheets of paper or notebook i.e. handwritten. Each sheet/page must have your name, roll number, date and signature. In midsem exam, we excused students who did not attest each page as instructed. In endsem exam, we will deduct 10 marks if one or more pages are found to be missing name OR roll number OR date OR signature. Solutions are to be uploaded using SAFE app. We recommend uploading solutions to individual questions as and when you are done solving them. Write your answers with sufficient details, so that we do not suspect any malpractice (e.g. write down all intermediate steps to a logic minimization question, draw intermediate BDDs while deriving ROBDD etc.) Only submissions made on SAFE will be counted for evaluation. You should make sure that your work is uploaded on SAFE. Additionally, we will create a submission link on Teams where you will be asked to upload all your sheets (photographs, scanned into PDF). This Teams submission will be only kept for backup (contingency), and not used for evaluation. All students must submit their work on SAFE (for evaluation) as well as on Teams. For midsem, the Teams deadline was continually extended, and some submissions were accepted by email and chat later. However, only those submissions received on Teams by the deadline will be considered for endsem.

10/11/2021, 18:29 - +91 99513 67352: <Media omitted>
10/11/2021, 18:30 - Manomukil T: So whichever faculty is listed in TCF irrespective of whether he took class for me or not I should put feedback?
10/11/2021, 18:31 - Nipun EE: Aight
10/11/2021, 18:31 - Rahul Desai: What are you implying
10/11/2021, 18:31 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>

10/11/2021, 18:31 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Ishaan Agarwal: Is it even compulsory?
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Aniruddha EE: Me too. I put everything. Nvm if it is anonym or not
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Aniruddha EE: If u want grades, yeah
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Rahul Desai: ~If you don't fill you won't get your grades~
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Dumb Q but should I fill for my instructors alone or everyone?
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Nipun EE: Fill for everyone
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Nipun EE: <Media omitted>
10/11/2021, 18:34 - Ishaan Agarwal: If it was anon, how'd they know if you submitted or not, thus the grade thing wouldn't be valid.
10/11/2021, 18:35 - Aniruddha EE: For others, put no for the first question
10/11/2021, 18:35 - Nipun EE: Tf
10/11/2021, 18:35 - Ishaan Agarwal: Any proof of this?
10/11/2021, 18:35 - Ishaan Agarwal: So it's clearly NOT anonymous right.
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Aniruddha EE: ~No. Just a trick from admin to get feedback~
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Ishaan Agarwal: Or maybe they use cryptography 🤔
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Aniruddha EE: Bruh, it would be sus if you give feedback for a prof who handled another batch
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Aditya S Sadhu: Eggzactly
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Aditya S Sadhu: Key pairs n all 😂
10/11/2021, 18:36 - Aditya S Sadhu: Too much tho, they don't care that much
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Rama Manoj: For 2025 do we need to give feedback for two profs? Both the teacher and supporting prof?
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Keerthana Rachuri: <Media omitted>
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Aniruddha EE: Who is a supporting prof?
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Nipun EE: I mean can't we leave them
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Rama Manoj: Ex bijoy, shivananju
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Keerthana Rachuri: Shh, just fill
10/11/2021, 18:37 - Ishaan Agarwal: Any official mail/notice saying that tcf is compulsory?
10/11/2021, 18:38 - Ishaan Agarwal: No I am lazy.
10/11/2021, 18:38 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: Whether you are done with feedback and the anonymity of the feedback is different
10/11/2021, 18:38 - Aniruddha EE: The first question is 'do u want to give feedback'. Select no and for the reason for not giving feedback, put that the prof wasn't my teacher
10/11/2021, 18:38 - Keerthana Rachuri: Nothing like that afaik but fill why take risk
10/11/2021, 18:39 - Nipun EE: 😂mb
10/11/2021, 18:39 - Ishaan Agarwal: <Media omitted>
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Aniruddha EE: Yes. Official mail came saying it is compulsary for grades and feedback is anonymous.
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Aditya S Sadhu: Also the password is ldap right?
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Rama Manoj: Woah is this what we need to do profs who didn't teach?
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Aniruddha EE: Click new user. U will get password in smail
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Aniruddha EE: That was the most reasonable thing to do
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Ishaan Agarwal: F
10/11/2021, 18:40 - Rama Manoj: Makes sense
10/11/2021, 18:42 - Soham Roy: Dude the government knows who has voted and who hasn't, doesn't mean voting isn't anonymous
10/11/2021, 18:44 - Ishaan Agarwal: Lol
10/11/2021, 18:44 - Ishaan Agarwal: Makes sense.
10/11/2021, 18:45 - Soham Roy: Bad ishaan

10/11/2021, 19:01 - Nikhil S: There's the tick right after you submitted the feedback so that info may go inside but the feedback may be stored without a label
10/11/2021, 19:07 - Gautam Vaja: It will just a Boolean map

10/11/2021, 21:19 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: I agree with that. The amount of rainfall is staggering and it becomes more difficult when there's already water logging
10/11/2021, 21:20 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: This year rainfall in TN is so high that I can bend and catch fish from my well 😂

10/11/2021, 21:21 - Nikhil S: Nope.. Every year nearly same situation but still no solution.. The main prob is not directly rain but because of dam openings..
10/11/2021, 21:21 - Kesava Aruna Prakash R L: It requires complete overhaul of most roads. Very difficult
10/11/2021, 21:21 - Nipun EE: Shut the depression, already endsems are killing us, let's feel heppi otherwise

11/11/2021, 21:10 - Soham Roy: hardware manufacturers take kilo etc as 1000, software takes as 1024
11/11/2021, 21:10 - Raunak P: I take it as potatoes and onions
11/11/2021, 21:10 - Rama Manoj: ++ dude got fricked
11/11/2021, 21:10 - Soham Roy: Yeah @917034204556 240*(1000/1024)^3 = 224
11/11/2021, 21:11 - Harisankar K J: What a coincidence! me too
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Soham Roy: Usually multiplying (1000/1024)^3 gives the actual size
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Rama Manoj: Oof so they advertise the size in 1000s of bytes if I understand this formula correctly?
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Rama Manoj: Instead of 1024s
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Srichandra: Doesn't using 1000 makes things a little different/difficult?
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Soham Roy: technically SI defines kilo mega etc in terms of 10s
11/11/2021, 21:13 - +91 88256 20176: that I get, but does it really make a difference as an ad strat?
11/11/2021, 21:13 - Soham Roy: software people decided on 1024
11/11/2021, 21:13 - Soham Roy: yeah

11/11/2021, 23:21 - Soham Roy: Yeah, 256KB * 1000 * 1000 gives 245 GB
11/11/2021, 23:21 - Nikhil S: oh yeah i remember while dual booting windows and ios full 500 gb it showed .. so not os

11/11/2021, 23:27 - Shrey Shah: I hold opposite views
11/11/2021, 23:27 - Shrey Shah: NZ deserves to win at least something man
11/11/2021, 23:28 - Shrey Shah: WC19 belonged to them

11/11/2021, 23:28 - Arjun R: ++😤
11/11/2021, 23:28 - Shrey Shah: They have been consistent for a long time
11/11/2021, 23:29 - +91 75590 68027: And one other thing they're consistently doing is beating the crap out of India in every icc event.
11/11/2021, 23:29 - Shrey Shah: And I am still pissed at the fact they didn't win wc19
11/11/2021, 23:29 - +91 75590 68027: I just don't like them🥲
11/11/2021, 23:29 - Shrey Shah: True
11/11/2021, 23:29 - +91 75590 68027: Well , to start with , if rain didn't interfere,  I'm pretty sure India deserved to win the semis

12/11/2021, 00:27 - Ishaan Agarwal: Ooh yeah, just noticed.
12/11/2021, 00:27 - Ishaan Agarwal: Same
12/11/2021, 00:30 - Manomukil T: I think it depends on whether it's HDD+SSD or just SSD
12/11/2021, 00:30 - Manomukil T: No aa?
12/11/2021, 00:31 - Nikhil S: Sadhu has hdd+ssd and I have only ssd both of us don't have full ssd usage so.. Nope I think.
12/11/2021, 00:31 - Nikhil S: I mean 256 means 256
12/11/2021, 00:31 - Nikhil S: Gives*
12/11/2021, 00:32 - Manomukil T: 256GB of free space or totally 256GB?
12/11/2021, 00:32 - Nikhil S: Advertised as 256 but got lesser than that.. In both cases..
12/11/2021, 00:33 - Manomukil T: It happens everywhere bro.. even in phones as well... thats y I feel it covers os+built in apps
12/11/2021, 00:34 - Nikhil S: In my case 512gb advertised got 490 I think. In that 70 gone for OS. 🥲
12/11/2021, 00:34 - Manomukil T: This message was deleted
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Manomukil T: Ok I get what ur telling
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Soham Roy: no
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Manomukil T: Yeah mb
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Soham Roy: hardware manufacturers consider kilo mega giga as 1000 so on
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Manomukil T: I got now what u were talking abt
12/11/2021, 00:36 - Soham Roy: software consider as 1024, hence the diff
12/11/2021, 00:37 - Soham Roy: yuys
12/11/2021, 00:37 - Manomukil T: But then I have a question
12/11/2021, 00:38 - Manomukil T: When I split the drive and tell it to allocate 50GB for the new drive it allocates 48.8 gb
12/11/2021, 00:38 - Manomukil T: While I try partitioning for a 100 gb it shows 99.0
12/11/2021, 00:38 - Manomukil T: Y so
12/11/2021, 00:39 - Soham Roy: idk never heard of something like this
12/11/2021, 00:40 - Soham Roy: maybe partition table recovery partition etc take some space
12/11/2021, 00:42 - Manomukil T: And one more thing
12/11/2021, 00:42 - Manomukil T: Even though this is right it also varies manufacturers to manufacturer if I'm not wrong
12/11/2021, 00:43 - Manomukil T: He said he got 490GB
12/11/2021, 00:43 - Manomukil T: I got only 478 GB
12/11/2021, 00:43 - Manomukil T: I think there are even lower spaces advertised as 512GB
12/11/2021, 00:43 - Manomukil T: Like 460 anol
12/11/2021, 00:44 - Soham Roy: That is 512*(1000/1024)^3
12/11/2021, 00:44 - Soham Roy: This is 512*(1000/1024)^2
12/11/2021, 00:44 - Manomukil T: Y the power?
12/11/2021, 00:44 - Soham Roy: That would be 500*(1000/1024)^3 maybe
12/11/2021, 00:45 - Soham Roy: Giga can mean 1000^3 or 1024^3
12/11/2021, 00:46 - Manomukil T: Coz it starts wrt to Bytes and from there we have to make this conversion?
12/11/2021, 00:46 - Soham Roy: Sometimes they might take 1024B as KB but use 1000^2 after that, partitioning stuff is done at KB = 1024B level
12/11/2021, 00:46 - Manomukil T: Oo
12/11/2021, 00:46 - Soham Roy: Yus
12/11/2021, 00:47 - Soham Roy: Some merciful manufacturer might give 500*(1000/1024)
12/11/2021, 00:47 - Manomukil T: But then when they say a file size is say 15GB will it differ laptop to laptop?
12/11/2021, 00:48 - Soham Roy: Software considers 1024 only
12/11/2021, 00:49 - Manomukil T: Hmm ok
12/11/2021, 00:50 - Nikhil S: This only I also got.. Checked now.
12/11/2021, 00:51 - Nikhil S: What lap?
12/11/2021, 00:51 - Manomukil T: In that also if I'm not wrong u loose around another 1.2  - 1.5 GB apart from the 70GB for windows
12/11/2021, 00:51 - Manomukil T: Recovery and EFI partition
12/11/2021, 00:52 - Manomukil T: Lenovo IdeaPad L3
12/11/2021, 00:52 - Nikhil S: Possibly.

12/11/2021, 11:17 - Nikhil S: But 5th years are in their final years so they may ask them to go back considering the placement time.. And no other lab and proper work but for us it's different right?

14/11/2021, 15:24 - Keerthana Rachuri: Respected sir,         
I have shared this with my batchmates. Many of them are requesting an exam in the given slot itself instead of having an offline endsem after insti reopening. Once we reach insti, we will already be having a lot of pending labs and workshops from 1st year which need to be finished; an offline endsem being added to it will be very difficult for us, especially considering that we haven't experienced offline classes. Not to mention the course being full of heavy formulae and requires a lot of memorising, which makes it even more stressful to postpone it too much after the end of classes. Besides all this, as this is the first time we are going to be on campus, we will be facing a lot of issues adjusting to hostel life and acads pressure on top of it will only make it even worse. Sir, after having 3 semesters online, we are going to insti for the first time, I hope you understand why we do not want to spend more time studying as soon as we reach there. Hence, I request you to reconsider this decision, keeping these factors in mind. We would be really grateful if you could reconsider

Thank you.

14/11/2021, 20:41 - Harisankar K J: No point of asking imo
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Keerthana Rachuri: Do u guys want me to mail sir asking for best 2 out of 3 or will go with sir's marking scheme?
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Bijo John: Go with this, damage reduction primary aim
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Rahul Desai: First one would be good but if we ask for it now he might even remove the second one
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Chinmaya: If we are writing the quiz it's to reduce endsem pressure
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Rahul Desai: Yee
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Keerthana Rachuri: Ah he will not do that I think
14/11/2021, 20:41 - Bijo John: ++ so just keep endsem as 40%
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Rahul Desai: But still 
Less endsem weightage= less pressure
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Chinmaya: Don't suggest anything new pls
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Chinmaya: Anil sir doesn't need new ideas
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Abhiram: What’s wrong in having a best 2 out of 3?
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Rahul Desai: Chinmoy no 
Please don't be sed
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Chinmaya: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Bijo John: Not really, but then again we have somewhat more wriggle room
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Bijo John: 50% endsem 🥲
14/11/2021, 20:42 - Chinmaya: It doesn't matter when u have scored 25 in first 2 :)
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Chinmaya: ++
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Rushill Bairavan: Course is anyways RG, no need to take up extra quiz(extra stress) to reduce endsems weightage
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Abhiram: There’s not really much difference, you’ll have to cover the same syllabus for either 40/50 marks
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Bijo John: Offline 2025 is a DISASTER
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Chinmaya: Sse

14/11/2021, 20:43 - Bijo John: I don't trust tomprs of that level
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Chinmaya: Offline exams lite only it seems
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Chinmaya: Only hard to copy
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Abhiram: It’s the same for everyone right
14/11/2021, 20:43 - Chinmaya: Ya
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Chinmaya: Have online quiz, increase rg before endsem
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Rahul Desai: 10% is much difference in rg 
And yes I would have to cover same syllabus but if weightage of endsem is decreasing no of questions will too and of no of questions is same I can risk a question
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Bijo John: True, but then again fuckups are so easy to happen. I know so many people who freak out with proctoring
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Bijo John: It'll take some getting used to
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Rahul Desai: ++
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Bijo John: + it's gonna be difficult to study
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Rushill Bairavan: People have been writing exams offline for their entire life
14/11/2021, 20:44 - Rahul Desai: ++
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Rama Manoj: ++people with good marks are forced to write it anyway, this will increase class average and excellent marks will be getting Bs
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Bijo John: True, but we're way too out kf practice
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Abhiram: What proctoring are you referring to?
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Rushill Bairavan: It's ame for everyone, won't matter in rg
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Abhiram: Dude it’s the same for everyone
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Rahul Desai: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Bijo John: Offline mein prof will be there na
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Rama Manoj: Less qs in endsem is more dangerous, it becomes more luck dependent
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Bijo John: Depends, rama gonna rg me to death
14/11/2021, 20:45 - Rushill Bairavan: You will have to study anyways even if it has 40 weightage
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Abhiram: Huh uh
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Bijo John: Yes, but I'm pretty sure I won't reach full efficiency, and I wanna reduce damage coz of that
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Abhiram: Exactly
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Rushill Bairavan: Someone else might perform worse due to quarantine
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Bijo John: Yeah, so why magnify this weird factor
14/11/2021, 20:46 - Rama Manoj: See I got 42 both quizzes combined, pretty decent, but I'm still forced to write it if I want to hold my standing
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Srichandra: I didn't even start yet 😂🥲
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Bijo John: Yeah, but you'll study in quarantine
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Rama Manoj: Rg will get worse as silly mistakes get averaged out
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Bijo John: I might for a limited time
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Rama Manoj: So will you don't lie
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Rushill Bairavan: To not read something relatively new for a quiz, and then have to revise it anyways for endsems?
14/11/2021, 20:47 - Manomukil T: 20 marks loading I see
14/11/2021, 20:48 - Bijo John: That's supposed to be the norm, you're supposed to be fully prepared for an endsem right?
14/11/2021, 20:48 - Rama Manoj: 2 lecs left🥲
14/11/2021, 20:48 - Keerthana Rachuri: It has its pros and cons, we don't know how much that 10 marks will cost us
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Rushill Bairavan: Endsems happening a  month after the course is done is not the norm, you will have to put in extra effort for this
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Rama Manoj: ++
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Bijo John: True, but inevitable
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Abhiram: But why’s there a talk of having another quiz now literally before the endsems?
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Rama Manoj: Anyway let's just put what we want and let the poll do its thing🥲
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Keerthana Rachuri: Okay i am asking  lol
14/11/2021, 20:49 - Rama Manoj: This message was deleted
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Rama Manoj: One quiz is avoidable right
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Srichandra: 42 uh nice 🙏🏻
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Chinmaya: Ok so see
Pros of having 3 quiz + endsem
1) Less weightage for endsem(less pressure? Idk)
2) A chance for people who have done bad in one or both of the quizzes to redeem themselves 

Cons of having 3 quiz + endsem
1) U have to study now also + for endsem also(more study more pressure)
2) No guarantee of doing well, antennas is hard concept 
3) No cheating in offline exam i.e. less rg

Pros of having best 2/3

1) Real chance to redeem(this is actually good)

Cons

1)More study
2)Endsem weightage doesn't change
3)Giving anil sir new ideas is not good, speaking from past experience :-)
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Rama Manoj: Frick wrong tag
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Bijo John: This yes, still endsem is a month later
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Rama Manoj: .
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Keerthana Rachuri: 😂 shh
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Rushill Bairavan: Writing a quiz is too much stress to reduce 10 marks in endsems, the unfavorable conditions of which are going to be the same for everyone anyways imo
14/11/2021, 20:50 - Chinmaya: Read full🔪
14/11/2021, 20:51 - Rama Manoj: This is just playing Russian roulette
14/11/2021, 20:51 - Abhiram: But why do we have to write another quiz now ?
14/11/2021, 20:51 - Rama Manoj: We all will mess up on atleast one quiz
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Chinmaya: Someone gets it
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Bijo John: It's not just reducing 10 marks lol, it's damage reduction on previous quizzes as well. Honestly, I did horribly bad
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Rama Manoj: ++
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Rushill Bairavan: Also, I think that 2025 is the last non HS endsem, so you are literally cutting into your holidays to write this quiz
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Rama Manoj: ++
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Abhiram: Exactly
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Manomukil T: Ukw put a doc with all ur views like some election manifesto
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Sanjay Sattva: +++
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Ria Ann: this
14/11/2021, 20:52 - Chinmaya: It truly depends on the silent killers in this group, who don't voice their opinion
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Rama Manoj: I bet I'll have to finish antennas syllabus and study hard for this quiz🥲
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Abhiram: If it’s just damage reduction, you can have the best 2/3 thingy na
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Rama Manoj: And get fricked by silly mistakes anyway
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: See
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Bijo John: You'll still have to study for HS, doesn't change anything except for a lucky few
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: Many havent
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Rushill Bairavan: Then ig there's no use in talking about this, everyone will vote depending upon whether they think they can score better in antennae
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: Okay whatever I'm fine with anything now
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: Do whatever
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Bijo John: Yeah, but anil won't agree 😂
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Rama Manoj: More chill tho
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Abhiram: Bruh I didn’t sign up for an extra quiz
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: @917034204556 more chill it seems
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Rama Manoj: 😂
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Abhiram: And an endsem a month later on top of that
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Chinmaya: Hrj is
14/11/2021, 20:53 - Bijo John: Me who flunked every single hs class :)
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Chinmaya: Lolol
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Chinmaya: I voted no btw
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Rama Manoj: Twosome or a threesome, you decide bruh
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Abhiram: I’m just saying in gen lol
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Chinmaya: Personal Tutorial discussion was sufficient practice for me
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Rama Manoj: ++
14/11/2021, 20:54 - Abhiram: It doesn’t make sense to have a pattern change to introduce a compulsory quiz now
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Aniruddha EE: Exactly... Double revisiin
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Bijo John: Umm sense okay, but just say if it's good for you or not
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Bijo John: Ig ans depends on how well you did before
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Abhiram: Yeah I either want to get done with it, or have it later on, why do both
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Bijo John: Can't have an objective view on it tbh
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Keerthana Rachuri: Okay mail is sent, now it is in sirs hands, u guys can relax
14/11/2021, 20:55 - Rushill Bairavan: Is antennae supposed to be the hardest part?
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Rushill Bairavan: What about gform?
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Abhiram: @919743812852bolo sir
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Rama Manoj: ++I am biased by the fact that I'm ill prepared and I don't want my avg down due to this quiz
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Keerthana Rachuri: Let it be, i will take it down if required based on his reply
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Abhiram: True that oof
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Rama Manoj: We are all selfish af😂
14/11/2021, 20:56 - Aniruddha EE: ++ if we are anyway going to do antennas for endsems, why not do it only for endsems. If we don't have a quiz now, atleast I can prepare for other endsems in peace
14/11/2021, 20:57 - Aniruddha EE: Extra quiz achieves nothing as it is not best 2 out of 3
14/11/2021, 20:58 - Aniruddha EE: Maigod, people actually want a quiz. 😬. 40 marks or 60 marks, Anil is anyway goin to keep a 3hr endsem.
14/11/2021, 20:59 - Rushill Bairavan: It will help people who have performed below their level in previous quizzes, not much else
14/11/2021, 20:59 - Aniruddha EE: Dei, prepare in peace and ace the endsem. Why do u want to study in a hurry and do a quiz next week
14/11/2021, 21:01 - Rushill Bairavan: Presence of this quiz will not impact your performance in endsems, you can prepare in peace even after writing it
14/11/2021, 21:01 - Rushill Bairavan: I'm playing the devil's advocate lol
14/11/2021, 21:02 - Aniruddha EE: It will impact the 20 marks this quiz is for. I don't have time to prepare for this quiz bruh
14/11/2021, 21:02 - Aniruddha EE: You are the devil lol. Not the advocate
14/11/2021, 21:02 - Rushill Bairavan: Arre I don't want the quiz
14/11/2021, 21:03 - Keerthana Rachuri: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 21:03 - Aniruddha EE: Then join me and spread propaganda against the quiz.
14/11/2021, 21:04 - Rushill Bairavan: This guy introduces the drama, the stress _and_ the heartache
14/11/2021, 21:04 - Nikhil S: Bruh why are other courses keeping best of option then 🤨
14/11/2021, 21:04 - Aniruddha EE: 🥲 why quiz if it is not best 2 out of 3?
14/11/2021, 21:04 - Rakshit Pandey: True 😭
14/11/2021, 21:05 - Rushill Bairavan: So finally quiz is there right?
14/11/2021, 21:05 - Keerthana Rachuri: Mostly yeah, most of the people kept yes, i think u guys can see the poll
14/11/2021, 21:05 - Rahul Desai: Not yet decided
14/11/2021, 21:05 - Aniruddha EE: 🥲

14/11/2021, 21:08 - Aniruddha EE: By just 20 percent. Not worth it imo
14/11/2021, 21:08 - Rushill Bairavan: Everyone wants to increase their standing, rg won't allow this 😂

14/11/2021, 21:10 - Nikhil S: Please announce no 2/3 option in notices and ask people to chnage their option if they want!
14/11/2021, 21:11 - Rushill Bairavan: Last paragraph is hypocrite max, he tells us not to care about it, but he obviously cares enough to make it offline

14/11/2021, 21:11 - Bijo John: She might've edited an option
14/11/2021, 21:11 - Bijo John: Just sum up both NOs

14/11/2021, 21:22 - Rama Manoj: ++😂
14/11/2021, 21:25 - Aniruddha EE: exactly lmao
14/11/2021, 21:26 - Keerthana Rachuri: To be fair, he never asked us for opinion, he decided and just wanted to inform us, we were the one who started the discussion
14/11/2021, 21:27 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Yeah now it seems like that

14/11/2021, 21:30 - Antonson J: I feel happy for you all pa.
I lost a lot coz of considering best n-1. It was mostly a bad one for me. Loosing so many grades in less than 1 mark margin is real pain, just beacuse the profs considered best n-1 which boosted ppl who scammed nicely in easy exams.
14/11/2021, 21:30 - Antonson J: Haa. I didn't
14/11/2021, 21:30 - Niyas Mon P: It is just an exm..why not online😀 🔪

14/11/2021, 21:32 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Dept profs*
14/11/2021, 21:33 - Aniruddha EE: we have crossed the limit of hope for online endsem. now we are just doing damage limitation
14/11/2021, 21:33 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: So exam will clash with labs and workshops ryt??
14/11/2021, 21:33 - Keerthana Rachuri: I think you are the first person I have seen until now who said that they like anil sir

14/11/2021, 21:34 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: But 2025??

14/11/2021, 21:36 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Ohhh kk got it
14/11/2021, 21:37 - Aniruddha EE: There will be some people who couldnt go to KVs right? I also heard ED guys have an endsem offline just like us
14/11/2021, 21:37 - Chinmaya: Lol rip
14/11/2021, 21:38 - Chinmaya: They have to study those age old concepts again

14/11/2021, 21:40 - Kaushik Ravibaskar: Ofc each and every event has it's own place in time, which justifies itself, anything later of before it spoils it, it's like a harmony of events which makes it beautiful or less painful 🙂
14/11/2021, 21:40 - Shrey Shah: Yes
